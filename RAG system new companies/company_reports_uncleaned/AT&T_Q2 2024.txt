PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as “we,” “AT&T” or the “Company.” The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries and affiliates which we control. AT&T is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries. You should read this document in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for the full year. These consolidated financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the presented interim periods, consisting of normal recurring accruals and other items.All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in subsidiaries and partnerships which we do not control but have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included in our results on a one quarter lag. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including translation adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, including estimates of fair value, probable losses and expenses, that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 2. EARNINGS PER SHARE A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per share is shown in the table below:On April 5, 2023, we repurchased all our Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in AT&T Mobility II LLC (Mobility preferred interests). For periods prior to repurchase, under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity” (ASU 2020-06), the ability to settle the Mobility preferred interests in stock was reflected in our diluted earnings per share calculation.9AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsNOTE 3.

SEGMENT INFORMATION Our segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America. We also evaluate segment and business unit performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenue.The Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect integrated product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:•Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment.•Business Wireline provides advanced ethernet-based fiber services, IP Voice and managed professional services, as well as traditional voice and data services and related equipment to business customers. In the first quarter of 2024, we began 10AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsoffering our fixed wireless access product that provides internet services delivered over our 5G wireless network where available.•Consumer Wireline provides broadband services, including fiber connections that provide multi-gig services to residential customers in select locations and our fixed wireless access product that provides home internet services delivered over our 5G wireless network where available. Consumer Wireline also provides legacy telephony voice communication services.The Latin America segment provides wireless services and equipment in Mexico. Corporate and Other reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes. Corporate includes:•DTV-related retained costs, which are costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV) under transition service agreements.•Parent administration support, which includes costs borne by AT&T where the business units do not influence decision making.•Securitization fees associated with our sales of receivables (see Note 8).•Value portfolio, which are businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market. Other items consist of:•Certain significant items, which includes items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets, employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, asset impairments and abandonments and restructuring, and other items for which the segments are not being evaluated. “Interest expense” and “Other income (expense) – net” are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results.11AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amounts12AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsThe following table is a reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to “Income Before Income Taxes” reported in our consolidated statements of income:13AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsNOTE 5. REVENUE RECOGNITIONRevenue CategoriesThe following tables set forth reported revenue by category and by business unit: 14AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsDeferred Customer Contract Acquisition and Fulfillment CostsCosts to acquire and fulfill customer contracts, including commissions on service activations for our Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline services, are deferred and amortized over the contract period or expected customer relationship life, which typically ranges from three years to five years. The following table presents the deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs included on our consolidated balance sheets:The following table presents deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment cost amortization, which are primarily included in “Selling, general and administrative” and “Other cost of revenues,” respectively, for the six months ended: Contract Assets and LiabilitiesA contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to bill and receive consideration. The contract asset will decrease as services are provided and billed. For example, when installment sales include promotional discounts (e.g., trade-in device credits) the difference between revenue recognized and consideration received is recorded as a contract asset to be amortized over the contract term.Our contract assets primarily relate to our wireless businesses. Promotional equipment sales where we offer handset credits, which are allocated between equipment and service in proportion to their standalone selling prices, when customers commit to a 15AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsspecified service period result in additional contract assets recognized. These contract assets will amortize over the service contract period, resulting in lower future service revenue. When consideration is received in advance of the delivery of goods or services, a contract liability is recorded. Reductions in the contract liability will be recorded as we satisfy the performance obligations. The following table presents contract assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets:Our beginning of period contract liability recorded as customer contract revenue during 2024 was $3,142. Remaining Performance ObligationsRemaining performance obligations represent services we are required to provide to customers under bundled or discounted arrangements, which are satisfied as services are provided over the contract term. In determining the transaction price allocated, we do not include non-recurring charges and estimates for usage, nor do we consider arrangements with an original expected duration of less than one year, which are primarily prepaid wireless and residential internet agreements. Remaining performance obligations associated with business contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. Performance obligations associated with wireless contracts are estimated using a portfolio approach in which we review all relevant promotional activities, calculating the remaining performance obligation using the average service component for the portfolio and the average device price. As of June 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $38,744, of which we expect to recognize approximately 72% by the end of 2025, with the balance recognized thereafter. NOTE 6. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS Many of our employees are covered by one of our noncontributory pension plans. We also provide certain medical, dental, life insurance and death benefits to certain retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially determined postretirement benefit costs. Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient to provide benefits described in the plans to employees upon their retirement. We do not have significant funding requirements in 2024. We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets in our consolidated results as a component of “Other income (expense) – net” at our annual measurement date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. 16AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsThe following table details qualified pension and postretirement benefit costs included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The service cost component of net periodic pension (credit) cost is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income while the remaining components are recorded in “Other income (expense) – net.”We also provide senior- and middle-management employees with nonqualified, unfunded supplemental retirement and savings plans. Net supplemental pension benefits costs not included in the table above were $16 and $18 in the second quarter and $33 and $37 for the first six months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.NOTE 7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE The Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework in ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” provides a three-tiered fair value hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December 31, 2023. 17AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsLong-Term Debt and Other Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and other financial instruments are summarized as follows:The carrying amount of debt with an original maturity of less than one year approximates fair value. The fair value measurements used for notes and debentures are considered Level 2 and are determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets. Following is the fair value leveling for investment securities that are measured at fair value and derivatives as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected as “Prepaid and other current assets,” “Other Assets,” “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities,” and “Other noncurrent liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets.18AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsInvestment SecuritiesOur investment securities include both equity and debt securities that are measured at fair value, as well as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. A substantial portion of the fair values of our investment securities is estimated based on quoted market prices. Investments in equity securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued at cost, less any impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable, orderly transactions for identical or similar securities. Investments in debt securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. The components comprising total gains and losses in the period on equity securities are as follows:At June 30, 2024, available-for-sale debt securities totaling $1,169 have maturities as follows - less than one year: $62; one to three years: $192; three to five years: $116; five or more years: $799. Our cash equivalents (money market securities), short-term investments (certificate and time deposits) and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded in “Prepaid and other current assets” and our investment securities are recorded in “Other Assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe enter into derivative transactions to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged. Fair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount. We also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For cross-currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Unrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such excluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Except for excluded components, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities through earnings. In the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value hedges. 19AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsCash Flow Hedging We designate some of our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk generated from our foreign-denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings.Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $59 from accumulated OCI to “Interest expense” due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At June 30, 2024, we had posted collateral of $680 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $0 (a receipt liability). Under the agreements, if AT&T’s credit rating had been downgraded two ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, one level by S&P and one level by Moody’s before the final collateral exchange in June, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $50. If AT&T’s credit rating had been downgraded three ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&P, and two levels by Moody’s, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $3,594. At December 31, 2023, we had posted collateral of $670 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $5 (a receipt liability). We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments. Following are the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative positions: 20AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsFollowing are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance:In addition, the net swap settlements that accrued and settled in the periods above were offset against “Interest expense.” The following table presents information for our cash flow hedging relationships:NOTE 8. SALES OF RECEIVABLES We have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and beneficial interests, such as deferred purchase price, when applicable, and (2) revolving trade receivables, which are sold for cash. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, we continue to service the transferred receivables on behalf of the financial institutions.21AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsThe following table sets forth a summary of cash proceeds received, net of remittances paid, from sales of receivables:The sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to “Total Assets” reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In the event cash is received on the beneficial interests, those receipts are classified as cash flows from investing activities, when applicable. Our equipment installment and revolving receivables programs are discussed in detail below. The following table sets forth a summary of the receivables and accounts being serviced:Equipment Installment Receivables ProgramWe offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a specified period of time and, in many cases, once certain conditions are met, they may be eligible to trade in the original equipment for a new device and have the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled. We maintain a program under which we transfer a portion of these receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary in exchange for cash and beneficial interests. In the event a customer trades in a device prior to the end of the installment contract period, we agree to make a payment to the financial institutions equal to any outstanding remaining installment receivable balance. Accordingly, we record a guarantee obligation for this estimated amount at the time the receivables are transferred. 22AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsThe following table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables sold under this program:Beneficial interests, when applicable, and guarantee obligations are initially recorded at estimated fair value and subsequently adjusted for changes in present value of expected cash flows. The estimation of their fair values is based on remaining installment payments expected to be collected and the expected timing and value of device trade-ins. The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties and contemplates changes in value after the launch of a device model. The fair value measurements used for the beneficial interests and the guarantee obligation are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 7).The following table presents the previously transferred equipment installment receivables, which we repurchased in exchange for the associated beneficial interests:At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our beneficial interests were $2,764 and $2,270, respectively, of which $1,639 and $1,296 are included in “Prepaid and other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in “Other Assets.” The guarantee obligation at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $299 and $385, respectively, of which $106 and $111 are included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in “Other noncurrent liabilities.” Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the total amount of our beneficial interests and guarantee obligation.Revolving Receivables ProgramDuring the first quarter of 2024, we expanded our revolving agreement to transfer up to $1,800 of certain receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. This agreement is subject to renewal on an annual basis and the transfer limit may be expanded or reduced from time to time. As customers pay their balances, we transfer additional receivables into the program, resulting in our gross receivables sold exceeding net cash flow impacts (e.g., collect and reinvest). The transferred receivables are fully guaranteed by our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries, which hold additional receivables in the amount of $1,260 that are pledged as collateral under this agreement. The transfers are recorded at fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the derecognized amount outstanding.23AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsThe following table sets forth a summary of the revolving receivables sold:NOTE 9. TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTVWe account for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method and record our share of DIRECTV earnings as equity in net income of affiliates, with DIRECTV considered a related party.At June 30, 2024, our investment in DIRECTV was $293. The following table sets forth our share of DIRECTV’s earnings included in “Equity in net income of affiliates” and cash distributions received from DIRECTV:For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we billed DIRECTV approximately $134 and $279 under commercial arrangements and transition service agreements, which were recorded as a reduction to the operations and support expenses incurred.At June 30, 2024, we had accounts receivable from DIRECTV of $247 and accounts payable to DIRECTV of $50.We are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support, other than as noted above, as our involvement with DIRECTV is limited to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet.NOTE 10. SUPPLIER AND VENDOR FINANCING PROGRAMSSupplier Financing ProgramWe actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash and seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payment at their cost. Our supplier financing program does not result in changes to our normal, contracted payment cycles or cash from operations. 24AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsAt the supplier’s election, they can receive payment of AT&T obligations prior to the scheduled due dates, at a discounted price from the third-party financial institution. The discounted price paid by participating suppliers is based on a variable rate that is indexed to the overnight borrowing rate. We agree to pay the financial institution the stated amount generally within 90 days of receipt of the invoice. We do not have pledged assets or other guarantees under our supplier financing program. Suppliers had elected to sell to the third-party financial institutions $3,059 and $2,844 of our outstanding payment obligations as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our supplier financing programs are reported as operating or investing (when capitalizable) activities in our statements of cash flows when paid. Direct Supplier FinancingWe also have arrangements with suppliers of handset inventory that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (variable rate extension fee). We had $3,432 of direct supplier financing outstanding at June 30, 2024 and $5,442 as of December 31, 2023, which are included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our direct supplier financing is reported as operating activities in our statements of cash flows when paid.Vendor FinancingIn connection with capital improvements and the acquisition of other productive assets, we negotiate favorable payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing), which are reported as financing activities in our statements of cash flows when paid. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded vendor financing commitments related to capital investments of $523 and $1,341, respectively. We had $1,827 of vendor financing payables at June 30, 2024, with $883 included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” and $2,833 of vendor financing payables at December 31, 2023, with $1,975 included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.”NOTE 11.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results Our financial results are summarized in the discussions that follow. Additional analysis is discussed in our “Segment Results” section. Operating revenues decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, reflecting declines in Business Wireline service and Mobility equipment revenues, partially offset by Mobility service, Consumer Wireline and Mexico revenues. Operations and support expenses increased in the second quarter and decreased for the first six months of 2024. The increase in the second quarter reflects $480 of restructuring charges primarily related to termination fees of a RAN vendor whose equipment is being phased out of our network as part of our network modernization programs. This increase is largely offset by lower Mobility equipment costs resulting from lower wireless sales volumes and expense declines from our continued transformation efforts. Expense decreases for the first six months reflect lower Mobility equipment costs and our transformation efforts that were partially offset by higher restructuring charges associated with our deployment of Open RAN.Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to the shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless network equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our deployment of Open RAN. Also contributing to higher depreciation expense was the impact of ongoing capital spending for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades. Operating income decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. Our operating income margin in the second quarter decreased from 21.4% in 2023 to 19.3% in 2024 and for the first six months decreased from 20.7% in 2023 to 19.4% in 2024.Interest expense increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with spectrum acquisitions, partially offset by lower debt balances. Interest expense for the first six months of 2023 also included distributions on Mobility preferred interests, which were repurchased on April 5, 2023.28AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsEquity in net income of affiliates decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to the performance of our investment in DIRECTV, which included our share of a gain on a sale-leaseback transaction by DIRECTV of approximately $100 in the first quarter of 2023 (see Note 9). Other income (expense) – net decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. The decreases were primarily driven by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits in 2024 and net actuarial and settlement gains in 2023 with no corresponding remeasurement in 2024 (see Note 6). Also contributing to the decrease for the first six months were first-quarter 2024 noncash impairments recognized on a held-for-sale business and an equity investment in a Latin America satellite business.Income tax expense decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to lower income before income tax. Our effective tax rate was 22.4% in the second quarter of 2024 and 22.7% for the first six months of 2024, versus 22.8% and 22.8% in the comparable periods in the prior year. Operating revenues decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily driven by declines in our Business Wireline business unit, which reflects lower demand for legacy services and product simplification, as well as the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to a new cybersecurity joint venture LevelBlue in the second quarter of 2024. Revenue declines were also driven by lower Mobility equipment revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Mobility and Consumer Wireline business units, driven by gains in wireless and broadband services. 29AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsOperating income decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. Our Communications segment operating income margin in the second quarter decreased from 24.9% in 2023 to 24.5% in 2024 and for the first six months decreased from 24.0% in 2023 to 23.9% in 2024.The following tables highlight other key measures of performance for Mobility:30AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsService revenue increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. The increases are largely due to growth from subscriber gains and postpaid phone average revenue per subscriber (ARPU) growth.ARPUARPU increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, reflecting pricing actions. ChurnThe effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins. Postpaid churn and postpaid phone-only churn were lower in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. Equipment revenue decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily driven by lower wireless sales volumes. Operations and support expenses decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to lower equipment costs driven by lower device sales. Depreciation expense increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our Open RAN deployment and network transformation, and ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion, which we expect to continue through the remainder of 2024. Operating income increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. Our Mobility operating income margin in the second quarter increased from 32.6% in 2023 to 32.8% in 2024 and for the first six months increased from 31.5% in 2023 to 32.1% in 2024. Our Mobility EBITDA margin in the second quarter increased from 43.0% in 2023 to 44.9% in 2024 and for the first six months increased from 41.8% in 2023 to 44.2% in 2024. EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization.31AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsService revenues decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, driven by lower demand for legacy voice, data and network services along with product simplification, partially offset by growth in connectivity services. We expect these trends to continue. Revenue declines also reflect the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to LevelBlue. Equipment revenues increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, driven by higher customer premises equipment sales, which are nonrecurring in nature. Operations and support expenses decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, and lower network access and customer support expenses. Partially offsetting the decreases were higher vendor credits in the second quarter of 2023 and higher equipment costs for the six-month period. Expense declines also reflect the contribution of our cybersecurity business. As part of our transformation activities, we expect operations and support expense improvements through the remainder of 2024 as we further right size our operations in alignment with the strategic direction of the business.Depreciation expense increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to ongoing capital investment for strategic initiatives such as fiber, which we expect to continue through the remainder of 2024. Operating income decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. Our Business Wireline operating income margin in the second quarter decreased from 7.5% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024 and for the first six months decreased from 7.3% in 2023 to 1.7% in 2024. Our Business Wireline EBITDA margin in the second quarter decreased from 32.8% in 2023 to 31.3% in 2024 and for the first six months decreased from 32.4% in 2023 to 30.1% in 2024.32AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsThe following tables highlight other key measures of performance for Consumer Wireline:Broadband revenues increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, driven by an increase in fiber customers, which we expect to continue as we invest further in building our fiber footprint, and higher ARPU due to prior-year promotional pricing, partially offset by declines in copper-based broadband services. Legacy voice and data service revenues decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, reflecting the continued decline in demand for these services in favor of other technologies, such as wireless and fiber services.33AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsOther service and equipment revenues decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, reflecting the continued decline in the number of VoIP customers. Operations and support expenses increased in the second quarter and decreased for the first six months of 2024. Expense increases in the second quarter were primarily due to higher network-related costs as our fiber build scales, largely offset by lower customer support costs. Expense decreases for the first six months were driven by lower customer support costs and operating taxes that were offset by higher network-related costs. Depreciation expense increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to ongoing capital spending for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades and expansion, which we expect to continue through the remainder of 2024. Operating income increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. Our Consumer Wireline operating income margin in the second quarter increased from 5.2% in 2023 to 5.5% in 2024 and for the first six months increased from 4.0% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024. Our Consumer Wireline EBITDA margin in the second quarter increased from 31.5% in 2023 to 32.8% in 2024 and for the first six months increased from 30.5% in 2023 to 32.7% in 2024.The following tables highlight other key measures of performance for Mexico:34AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsService revenues increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. The increase in the second quarter was primarily due to growth in subscribers and ARPU, as well as favorable foreign exchange impacts. The increase for the first six months reflects favorable exchange rates primarily from the first quarter of 2024, with subscriber and ARPU growth also contributing to higher revenues.Equipment revenues increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily driven by higher equipment sales and favorable foreign exchange impacts.Operations and support expenses increased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily due to increased equipment and selling costs resulting from higher sales and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Approximately 4% of Mexico expenses are U.S. dollar based, with the remainder in the local currency.Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024, primarily driven by lower in-service assets, partially offset by unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.Operating income improved in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2024. Our Mexico operating income margin in the second quarter increased from (4.0)% in 2023 to 0.5% in 2024 and for the first six months increased from (3.7)% in 2023 to 0.4% in 2024. Our Mexico EBITDA margin in the second quarter increased from 15.1% in 2023 to 16.1% in 2024 and for the first six months increased from 15.7% in 2023 to 16.5% in 2024.COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT Overview AT&T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. AT&T subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided.In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), Congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. Nonetheless, since then, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained, re-imposed or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. Recently, the FCC’s regulatory approach has depended on control of the executive branch, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations in a number of areas, while imposing or re-imposing regulations in other areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.Until 2015, the FCC classified fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as information services subject to minimal regulation. In 2015, the FCC reclassified such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC and imposed “net neutrality rules.” Since then, the FCC has twice reversed course, most recently again reclassifying such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC in an order adopted on April 25, 2024, and scheduled to take effect on July 22, 2024. Multiple trade associations and other parties have challenged the FCC’s 35AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsreclassification decision in appeals consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The trade associations have petitioned the Sixth Circuit to stay the FCC’s order. On July 12, 2024, the Sixth Circuit issued a temporary administrative stay of the FCC order until August 5, 2024, and requested additional briefing from the parties on the impact of the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.Since 2018, some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that established state net neutrality rules, including California and Vermont. We expect additional states may seek to impose net neutrality and other requirements on broadband in the future.On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law. The legislation appropriates $65,000 to support broadband deployment and adoption. The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) is responsible for distributing more than $48,000 of this funding, including $42,500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas through the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Programs. NTIA and states are in the process of administering these grants. Where appropriate, AT&T has applied for, and in some cases has been awarded, and may continue to apply for grants under this or other government infrastructure programs. The IIJA also appropriated $14,200 for establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program, replacing the Emergency Broadband Benefit program (established in December 2020 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021). Qualifying customers can receive up to thirty dollars per month (or seventy-five dollars per month for those on Tribal lands) to assist with their internet bill. AT&T participated in the ACP program. On March 4, 2024, the FCC announced that absent additional funding from Congress, April 2024 would be the last fully funded month for the ACP benefit. The ACP has now ended.On November 15, 2023, the FCC adopted rules to “facilitate” equal access to broadband and prevent digital discrimination in broadband access. The rules, which became effective March 22, 2024, prohibit covered entities from implementing policies or practices not justified by genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility, that differentially impact consumers’ access to broadband internet access service based on prohibited characteristics (including income level, race, and ethnicity) or that have such differential impact, whether intentional or not. The rules broadly apply prospectively to all aspects of an ISP’s service that could impact a consumer’s ability to access broadband, including deployment, marketing, and credit checks, among other things. We may be required to answer complaints alleging that the company has violated the FCC rules and those complaints may seek relief, including changes to our business practices or civil forfeitures that could result in significant costs or reputational harm. It is currently uncertain how the FCC will implement and enforce these new rules. Several business and consumer-oriented associations have filed appeals challenging the rules and those appeals have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit.Privacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative, regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance, further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data. During 2020-2021, we deployed 5G nationwide on “low band” spectrum on macro towers. Executing on recent spectrum purchases, we announced ongoing construction and continuing deployment of 5G on 3.45 GHz and C-band spectrum in 2022 and beyond. Additional spectrum will be needed industrywide for 5G and future services. In 2023, the federal government released a national spectrum strategy that focused on spectrum sharing but did not include specific timelines to make additional spectrum bands available for 5G and future generations of service. As a result, the federal government’s ability and intent to make sufficient spectrum available to the industry in needed timeframes remains uncertain.36AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We had $3,093 in cash and cash equivalents available at June 30, 2024, decreasing $3,629 since December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents included cash of $1,094 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of $1,999. Approximately $1,397 of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign entities in accounts predominantly outside of the U.S. and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation. For the first six months of 2024, cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations, including cash from our sale and transfer of our receivables to third parties, issuance of commercial paper and distributions from DIRECTV. These inflows were exceeded by cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses. The cash generated from operating activities was used to repay short-term borrowings and long-term debt, funding capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, and dividend payments to stockholders. We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesDuring the first six months of 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $16,640, compared to $16,600 for the first six months of 2023, reflecting operational growth and timing of working capital associated with device payments, as well as the first-quarter 2024 expansion of committed, cost-efficient receivable sales programs.We actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost (referred to as supplier financing program). In addition, for payments to suppliers of handset inventory, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as direct supplier financing). The net impact of direct supplier financing, including principal and interest payments, was to decrease cash from operating activities approximately $2,120 and $2,100 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All supplier financing payments are due within one year. (See Note 10)Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesFor the first six months of 2024, cash used in investing activities totaled $6,977 and consisted primarily of $8,118 (including interest during construction) for capital expenditures. During the first six months of 2024, we also paid $266 in cash on FirstNet sustainability payment. During the first six months of 2024, we received a return of investment of $586 from DIRECTV representing distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from DIRECTV (see Note 9). For capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. For the first six months of 2024, vendor financing payments were $1,391, compared to $3,756 for the first six months of 2023. Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2024 were $8,118, and when including $1,391 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $9,509 ($2,852 lower than the prior-year comparable period).The vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. During the first six months of 2024, we placed $523 of productive assets (primarily software) in service under vendor 37AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amountsfinancing arrangements (compared to $1,341 in the prior-year comparable period). The amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. Cash Provided by or Used in Financing ActivitiesFor the first six months of 2024, cash used in financing activities totaled $13,293 and was comprised of debt issuances and repayments, payments of dividends and vendor financing payments.A tabular summary of our debt activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 is as follows:The weighted average interest rate of our long-term debt portfolio, including credit agreement borrowings and the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.2% as of June 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. We had $126,253 of total notes and debentures outstanding at June 30, 2024. This also included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, and Australian dollar denominated debt that totaled approximately $32,113.At June 30, 2024, we had $5,249 of debt maturing within one year, consisting of $2,693 of commercial paper borrowings and $2,556 of long-term debt issuances. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 5.5% as of June 30, 2024 and 6.0% as of December 31, 2023.For the first six months of 2024, we paid $1,391 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to $3,756 in the prior-year comparable period. Total vendor financing payables included in our June 30, 2024 consolidated balance sheet were $1,827, with $883 due within one year (in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”) and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in “Other noncurrent liabilities”).At June 30, 2024, we had approximately 144 million shares remaining from our share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors in 2014. We paid dividends on common and preferred shares of $4,133 during the first six months of 2024, compared with $4,097 for the first six months of 2023. Dividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors totaled $0.5550 per share in the first six months of 2024 and 2023. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&T and long-term growth opportunities.Credit FacilitiesThe following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. We currently have one $12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2028 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2024.We also utilize other external financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.38AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- ContinuedDollars in millions except per share amounts Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. As of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.Collateral ArrangementsMost of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our approximate $37,100 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During the first six months of 2024, we posted approximately $15 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 7)OtherOur total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year), redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders’ equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At June 30, 2024, our debt ratio was 51.8%, compared to 54.8% at June 30, 2023 and 53.5% at December 31, 2023. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESAsset Valuations and Impairments As discussed in Note 1 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets are tested for impairment at least annually as of October 1, generally utilizing a quantitative approach. While an interim quantitative impairment was not warranted in the second quarter of 2024, because of the industry-wide secular decline of legacy voice, which has led to a faster-than-anticipated rate of decline for our legacy voice services in our Business Wireline reporting unit, and the potential of sustained higher discount rates, it is possible that the book values of one or more of our reporting units will exceed their respective fair values, which may result in the recognition of a noncash impairment of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third or fourth quarters of 2024 that could be material.Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskAt June 30, 2024, we had interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1,750 and a fair value of $(1). We have fixed-to-fixed and floating-to-fixed cross-currency swaps on foreign currency-denominated debt instruments with a U.S. dollar notional value of $35,351 to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges with a net fair value of $(3,673) at June 30, 2024. We had no rate locks at June 30, 2024.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresThe registrant maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2024. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 39AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSInformation set forth in this report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially.

Risk FactorsWe discuss in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 various risks that may materially affect our business. We use this section to update this discussion to reflect material developments since our Form 10-K was filed.Cyberattacks impacting our networks, systems or data or those of our suppliers or vendors may have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations.Cyberattacks – including through the use of malware, computer viruses, distributed denial of services attacks, ransomware attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems or accessing our data and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers – could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations. Cyberattacks can cause equipment or network failures, copying or loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or proprietary information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’, suppliers’ or vendors’ operations, which could result in significant expenses, potential investigations and legal liability, a loss of current or future customers and reputational damage. As our networks evolve, they are becoming increasingly reliant on software and cloud technologies to handle growing demands for data consumption. Cyberattacks against the Company and its suppliers and vendors have occurred in the past, will continue to occur in the future and are increasing in frequency, scope and potential harm over time. For example, in July 2024, the Company disclosed a cybersecurity incident on Item 1.05 of Form 8-K relating to the copying of mobile customer call data. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. Further, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our suppliers, vendors and other service providers. In addition, despite our efforts to detect unlawful intrusions, an attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it may take considerable time for us to obtain sufficient information about the nature, scope and timing of the incident as well as the impact or reasonably likely impact on us. Indeed, as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, a post-attack investigation may not be able to ascertain the entire scope of the attack’s impact.Extensive and costly efforts are undertaken to develop and test systems before deployment and to conduct ongoing monitoring and updating to prevent and withstand such attacks. While, to date, we have not been subject to a cyberattack that has had a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations, the preventive actions we take, or our suppliers or vendors take, to reduce the risks associated with cyberattacks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyberattack in the future.41AT&T INC.JUNE 30, 2024Item 2.

Article 4 − Contributions 4.1 Election to Make Contributions.(a) The Committee shall establish dates and other conditions for participation in the Plan and making contributions as it deems appropriate. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, each year an Employee who is an Eligible Employee as of September 30 may thereafter make an election on or prior to the last Business Day of the immediately following November (such election shall be cancelled if the Employee is not an Eligible Employee on the last day such an election may be made) to contribute on a pre-tax basis, through payroll deductions, any combination of the following: (1) From 1% to 50% (in whole percentage increments) of the Participant’s monthly Base Compensation, other than Annual Bonus, during the calendar year (the Plan Year for such contributions) following the calendar year of such election. Employees who are below the level of Senior Manager, as shown on the records of AT&T at the time of the election, may contribute no more than 25% or such other amount as determined by AT&T. 12(2) Up to 95% (in whole percentage increments) of a Short Term Incentive Award, or up to 50% (in whole percentage increments) of Annual Bonus (25% for Employees who are below 13the level of Senior Manager), in each case such contributions shall be made during the second calendar year (which is the Plan Year for such contributions) following the year of such election, except that in 2008 a separate election may be made with respect to contributions to be made in 2009. An Employee may make such an election with respect to the type of Award (Short Term Incentive Award or Annual Bonus) that the Employee is under as of the time the Employee’s eligibility to make such election is determined. If because of a promotion or otherwise, the Employee receives a different type of Award instead of or in partial or full replacement for the type of Award subject to the Employee’s election for the relevant Plan Year, the election will apply to the other Award as well, including but not limited to any individual discretionary award related thereto. (b) The Committee may permit an Eligible Employee to make an election to make other contributions under this Plan with compensation other than Base Compensation or Short Term Incentive Awards on such terms and conditions as such Committee may permit from time to time provided that any such election is made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, no election shall be effective to the extent it would permit an Employee Contribution or distribution to be made that is not in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent such election related to Employee Contributions that complied with such statute and regulations, thereunder, that portion of the election shall remain valid, except as otherwise provided under this Plan. (d) To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, AT&T may refuse or terminate, in whole or in part, any election to make contributions to the Plan at any time; provided, however, only the Committee may take such action with respect to persons who are Officer Level Employees. (e) To the extent a Participant makes contributions to the Plan where the payment of which would be deductible by AT&T under Section 162(m) of the Code without regard to the size of the distribution, such contributions and earnings thereon shall be distributed first. (f) With respect to a Plan Year, an Employee may elect to (1) make Employee Contributions of Base Compensation other than Annual Bonus to this Plan but only if the Employee elects to contribute at least 6% of Base Compensation other than Annual Bonus for the same Plan Year to the Stock Purchase and Deferral Plan and/or (2) make Employee Contributions of Annual Bonus to this Plan but only if the Employee elects to contribute at least 6% of Annual Bonus for the same Plan Year to the Stock Purchase and Deferral Plan. 4.2 Contributions to a Cash Deferral Account.(a) Employee Contributions shall be made pursuant to a proper election, only during the Participant’s lifetime; provided, however, with respect to Employee Contribution elections made prior to 2007, the Employee must remain an Eligible Employee while making any such 14contributions. In the event of a Change in Control of an Employer, subsequent compensation from the Employer may not be contributed to the Plan. The Employer may continue the then 15current elections of the participants under a subsequent plan in order to comply with applicable tax laws. (b) A Participant’s contributions shall be credited to the Participant’s Cash Deferral Account on the day the compensation – from which the contribution is to be deducted – is to be paid (“paid,” as used in this Plan, includes amounts contributed to the Plan that would have been paid were it not for an election under this Plan), as determined by the relevant Employer. Earnings on each Cash Deferral Account shall be recorded on Participant’s statements quarterly. The Committee may modify or change this paragraph (b) from time to time. 4.3 Earnings on Cash Deferral Accounts.During a calendar year, the Participant’s Cash Deferral Account shall accrue interest on amounts held by such Account at the Plan Interest Rate for such year, compounded quarterly on the last day of each quarter. Interest will accrue on unpaid amounts in the Cash Deferral Account from the date credited to such Account. Article 5 − Distributions 5.1 Distributions of Cash Deferral Accounts.(a) Initial Election with Respect to a Cash Deferral Account. At the time the Participant makes an election to make Employee Contributions with respect to a Cash Deferral Account, the Participant shall also elect the calendar year of the distribution of the Cash Deferral Account and the number of installments. The Participant may elect either of the following: (i) Specified Date Distribution. That the distribution of the Cash Deferral Account commence in the calendar year specified by the Participant, but no later than the 10th calendar year after the Plan Year the Cash Deferral Account commenced, in up to Ten (10) installments. However, for purposes of Initial Elections with respect to Plan Years prior to 2009 only, in the event the Participant Terminates Employment prior to the calendar year of the distribution, the Cash Deferral Account must commence distribution the calendar year following the calendar year of the Termination of Employment, with the same number of installments, unless the Employee has made an irrevocable election under (b), below. For example, if the Participant elected a 2010 distribution with five (5) installments, but Terminated Employment in 2007, the Cash Deferral Account would commence distribution in 2008.(ii) Retirement Distribution. That the distribution of the Cash Deferral Account commence the calendar year following the calendar year of Retirement in up to (10) installments. If the Participant Terminates Employment while not Retirement eligible, the distribution shall commence the calendar year following the calendar year of Termination of Employment, but shall be limited to five (5) installments. This distribution alternative will not be available for Initial Elections made after 2007. If no timely distribution election is made by the Participant, then the Participant will be deemed to have made an election to have the Cash Deferral Account distributed in a single 16installment in the first calendar year after the calendar year Employee Contributions were first made. 17(b) Election to Delay a Specified Date Distribution. (i)If an Employee elected a Specified Date Distribution for a Cash Deferral Account, the Employee may elect to delay the Specified Date Distribution commencement date any time at least 12 months prior to the scheduled distribution and, as part of such delay election elect a new number of installments; provided, however, Termination of Employment will not accelerate the distribution, unlike the initial deferral election. Unless otherwise provided by AT&T, the election of a new distribution commencement date for a Cash Deferral Account must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the scheduled distribution date. (ii)To make this election, the Participant must be an Employee on the day of such election. The new distribution election must delay commencement of the distribution by five (5) or more years. (iii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan: a.an election to delay the Specified Date Distribution commencement date must be made at least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under the prior distribution election, and b.the election shall not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made. (c) A Participant’s Cash Deferral Account shall be distributed to the Participant on March 10 (or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, as determined by AT&T) of the calendar year elected by the Participant for the Account. In the event the distribution is to be made to a “Specified Employee” as a result of the Participant’s Termination of Employment (other than as a result of a Change in Control), the distribution shall not occur until the later of such March 10 or six (6) months after the Termination of Employment, except it shall be distributed upon the Participant’s earlier death in accordance with this Plan. The distributions shall continue annually on each successive March 10 (or such other date as determined by AT&T) until the number of installments elected by the Participant is reached. In each installment, AT&T shall distribute to the Participant that portion of the Participant’s Cash Deferral Account that is equal to the total dollar amount of the Participant’s Account divided by the number of remaining installments. (d) The Committee may establish other distribution alternatives from time to time, but such alternatives may be offered no earlier than the next period in which a Participant may make an election to establish a Cash Deferral Account. 5.2 Death of the Participant. 18In the event of the death of a Participant, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, all undistributed Cash Deferral Accounts shall be distributed to the Participant’s beneficiary in accordance with the AT&T Rules for Employee Beneficiary Designations, as the 19same may be amended from time to time, within the later of 90 days following such determination or the end of the calendar year in which determination was made. 5.3 Unforeseeable Emergency Distribution. If a Participant experiences an “Unforeseeable Emergency,” the Participant may submit a written petition to AT&T (the Committee in the case of Officer Level Employees), to receive a partial or full distribution of his Cash Deferral Account(s). In the event that AT&T (the Committee in the case of Officer Level Employees), upon review of the written petition of the Participant, determines in its sole discretion that the Participant has suffered an “Unforeseeable Emergency,” AT&T shall make a distribution to the Participant from the Participant’s Cash Deferral Accounts, on a pro-rata basis, within the later of 90 days following such determination or the end of the calendar year in which determination was made, subject to the following: (a) “Unforeseeable Emergency” shall mean a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant’s legal spouse, the Participant’s beneficiary, or the Participant’s dependent (as defined in Code Section 152, without regard to Code Section 152(b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B)); loss of the Participant’s property due to casualty; or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant, all as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Whether a Participant is faced with an Unforeseeable Emergency permitting a distribution is to be determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances of each case, but, in any case, a distribution on account of Unforeseeable Emergency shall not be made to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant’s assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship, or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan.(b) The amount of a distribution to be made because of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amount reasonably necessary, as determined by AT&T (the Committee in the case of Officer Level Employees) in its sole discretion, to satisfy the emergency need (which may include amounts necessary to pay any Federal, state, local, or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution). Determinations of the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need shall take into account any additional compensation that is available if the plan provides for cancellation of a deferral election upon a payment due to an Unforeseeable Emergency. The determination of amounts reasonably necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency need is not required to, but may, take into account any additional compensation that, due to the Unforeseeable Emergency, is available under another nonqualified deferred compensation plan but has not actually been paid, or that is available due to the Unforeseeable Emergency under another plan that would provide for deferred compensation except due to the application of the effective date provisions under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A−6. (c) Upon such distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency under this Plan, any election to make Employee Contributions by such Participant shall be immediately 20 21cancelled, and the Participant shall not be permitted to make a new election with respect to Employee Contributions that would be contributed during the then current and immediately following calendar year. 5.4 Ineligible Participant.Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan to the contrary, if AT&T receives an opinion from counsel selected by AT&T, or a final determination is made by a Federal, state or local government or agency, acting within its scope of authority, to the effect that an individual’s continued participation in the Plan would violate applicable law, then such person shall not make further contributions to the Plan to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code. 5.5 Conflict of Interest Distribution.AT&T may in its sole discretion accelerate a distribution(s) to the Participant, provided he or she is no longer actively employed by AT&T: (a) to the extent necessary for any Federal officer or employee in the executive branch to comply with an ethics agreement with the Federal government or (b) to the extent reasonably necessary to avoid the violation of an applicable Federal, state, local, or foreign ethics law or conflicts of interest law (including where such payment is reasonably necessary to permit the service provider to participate in activities in the normal course of his or her position in which the service provider would otherwise not be able to participate under an applicable rule).

Article 8 − Miscellaneous 8.1 Tax Withholding.Upon a distribution from a Participant’s Cash Deferral Account, AT&T shall withhold sufficient amounts to satisfy the minimum amount of Federal, state, and local taxes required by law to be withheld as a result of such distribution. 8.2 Loyalty Conditions for Officer Level Employees and Senior Managers.Each Officer Level Employee or a Senior Manager who elects to make Employee Contributions under Section 4.1 of this Plan shall be subject to the agreements and conditions of this section. The non-compete and non-solicitation provisions below do not apply to employees who live or work in California at the time of their termination of employment, or anywhere where such provisions are not permitted by law.(a)By making an Employee Contribution election under Section 4.1 of this Plan after September 1, 2009, a Participant acknowledges that AT&T would be unwilling to provide for such an election but for the loyalty conditions and covenants set forth in this section, and that the conditions and covenants herein are a material inducement to AT&T’s willingness to sponsor the Plan and to offer Plan benefits for the Participants. Accordingly, as a condition to making an Employee Contribution election under Section 4.1 of this Plan after September 1, 2009, each such electing Participant is deemed to agree that he shall not, without obtaining the written consent of the Committee in advance, participate in activities that constitute engaging in competition with AT&T or engaging in conduct disloyal to AT&T, as those terms are defined in this section. 26 (b)Definitions. For purposes of this section and of the Plan generally:(i)an “Employer Business” shall mean AT&T Inc. and any of its Subsidiaries, or any business in which they or any affiliate of theirs has a substantial ownership or joint venture interest; (ii)“engaging in competition with AT&T” shall mean, while employed by AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries, or within two (2) years after Participant’s Termination of Employment, engaging by the Participant in any business or activity in all or any portion of the same geographical market where the same or substantially similar business or activity is being carried on by an Employer Business. “Engaging in competition with AT&T” shall not include owning a non-substantial publicly traded interest as a shareholder in a business that competes with an Employer Business. “Engaging in competition with AT&T” shall include representing or providing consulting services to, or being an employee of, any person or entity that is engaged in competition with any Employer Business or that takes a position adverse to any Employer Business. (iii)“engaging in conduct disloyal to AT&T” means, while employed by AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries, or within two (2) years after Participant’s Termination of Employment, (i) soliciting for employment or hire, whether as an employee or as an independent contractor, for any business in competition with an Employer Business, any person employed by AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries during the one (1) year prior to the Participant’s Termination of Employment, whether or not acceptance of such position would constitute a breach of such person’s contractual obligations to AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) soliciting, encouraging, or inducing any vendor or supplier with which Participant had business contact on behalf of any Employer Business during the two (2) years prior to the Participant’s Termination of Employment (regardless of the reason for that termination) to terminate, discontinue, renegotiate, reduce, or otherwise cease or modify its relationship with AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) soliciting, encouraging, or inducing any customer or active prospective customer with whom Participant had business contact, whether in person or by other media (“Customer”), on behalf of any Employer Business during the two (2) years prior to the Participant’s Termination of Employment (regardless of the reason for that termination), to terminate, discontinue, renegotiate, reduce, or otherwise cease or modify its relationship with any Employer Business, or to purchase competing goods or services from a business competing with any Employer Business, or accepting or servicing business from such Customer on behalf of himself or any other business. “Engaging in conduct disloyal to AT&T” shall also mean, disclosing Confidential Information to any third party or using Confidential Information, other than for an Employer Business, or failing to return any 27Confidential Information to the Employer Business following termination of employment.(iv) 28(v)“Confidential Information” shall mean all information belonging to, or otherwise relating to, an Employer Business, which is not generally known, regardless of the manner in which it is stored or conveyed to Participant, and which the Employer Business has taken reasonable measures under the circumstances to protect from unauthorized use or disclosure. Confidential Information includes trade secrets as well as other proprietary knowledge, information, know-how, and non-public intellectual property rights, including unpublished or pending patent applications and all related patent rights, formulae, processes, discoveries, improvements, ideas, conceptions, compilations of data, and data, whether or not patentable or copyrightable and whether or not it has been conceived, originated, discovered, or developed in whole or in part by Participant. For example, Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, information concerning the Employer Business’ business plans, budgets, operations, products, strategies, marketing, sales, inventions, designs, costs, legal strategies, finances, employees, customers, prospective customers, licensees, or licensors; information received from third parties under confidential conditions; or other valuable financial, commercial, business, technical or marketing information concerning the Employer Business, or any of the products or services made, developed or sold by the Employer Business. Confidential Information does not include information that (i) was generally known to the public at the time of disclosure; (ii) was lawfully received by Participant from a third party; (iii) was known to Participant prior to receipt from the Employer Business; or (iv) was independently developed by Participant or independent third parties; in each of the foregoing circumstances, this exception applies only if such public knowledge or possession by an independent third party was without breach by Participant or any third party of any obligation of confidentiality or non-use, including but not limited to the obligations and restrictions set forth in this Plan. (c)Equitable Relief. The parties recognize that any Participant’s breach of any of the covenants in this section will cause irreparable injury to the AT&T, will represent a failure of the consideration under which AT&T (in its capacity as creator and sponsor of the Plan) agreed to provide the Participant with the opportunity to receive Plan benefits, and that monetary damages would not provide AT&T with an adequate or complete remedy that would warrant AT&T’s continued sponsorship of the Plan (including the accrual or granting of Share Units, Matching Share Units and Options) for all Participants. Accordingly, in the event of a Participant’s actual or threatened breach of the covenants in this section, the Committee, in addition to all other rights and acting as a fiduciary under ERISA on behalf of all Participants, shall have a fiduciary duty (in order to assure that AT&T receives fair and promised consideration for its continued Plan sponsorship and funding) to seek an injunction restraining the Participant from breaching the covenants in this Section. AT&T shall pay for any Plan expenses that the Committee incurs hereunder, and shall be entitled to recover from the Participant its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in obtaining such injunctive remedies. 29(d)Uniform Enforcement. In recognition of AT&T’s need for nationally uniform standards for the Plan administration, it is an absolute condition in consideration of any Participant’s ability to make Employee Contribution elections under Section 4.1 of this Plan after 30September 1, 2009, that each and all of the following conditions apply to all such electing Participants: (i)ERISA shall control all issues and controversies hereunder, and the Committee shall serve for purposes hereof as a “fiduciary” of the Plan and its “named fiduciary” within the meaning of ERISA.(ii)All litigation between the parties relating to this section shall occur in federal court, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction; any such litigation shall be held in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, and the only remedies available with respect to the Plan shall be those provided under ERISA. 8.3 Elections and Notices. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, all elections and notices of every kind under this Plan shall be made (1) on forms prepared by AT&T or the General Counsel, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, or their respective delegates, or (2) in such other manner as permitted or required by AT&T or the General Counsel, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, or their respective delegates, including through electronic means, over the Internet or otherwise. An election shall be deemed made when received by AT&T (or its designated agent, but only in cases where the designated agent has been appointed for the purpose of receiving such election), which may waive any defects in form. Unless made irrevocable by the electing person, each election with regard to making Employee Contributions or distributions of Cash Deferral Accounts shall become irrevocable at the close of business on the last day the Employee is permitted to make such election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, AT&T may place additional limits on the times during which elections may be made to make contribution(s) or to delay distribution(s). If not otherwise specified by this Plan or AT&T, any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to AT&T under the Plan shall be delivered to the principal office of AT&T, directed to the attention of the Senior Executive Vice President in charge of Human Resources for AT&T or his or her successor. Such notice shall be deemed given on the date of delivery. Notice to the Participant shall be deemed given when mailed (or sent by telecopy) to the Participant’s work or home address as shown on the records of AT&T or, at the option of AT&T, to the Participant’s e-mail address as shown on the records of AT&T. It is the Participant’s responsibility to ensure that the Participant’s addresses are kept up to date on the records of AT&T. In the case of notices affecting multiple Participants, the notices may be given by general distribution at the Participants’ work locations. By participating in the Plan, each Participant agrees that AT&T may provide any documents required or permitted under the Federal or state securities laws, including but not limited to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 31amended, by e-mail, by e-mail attachment, or by notice by e-mail of electronic delivery through AT&T’s Internet Web site or by other electronic means. 328.4 Unsecured General Creditor.Participants and their beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interest, or claims in any property or assets of any Employer. No assets of any Employer shall be held under any trust for the benefit of Participants, their beneficiaries, heirs, successors, or assigns, or held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of any Employer under this Plan. Any and all of each Employer’s assets shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of such Employer. The only obligation of an Employer under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of AT&T to make distributions under and in accordance with the terms of the Plan. 8.5 Non-Assignability.Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt, any Cash Deferral Account under the Plan, if any, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable. No part of a distributable Cash Deferral Account shall, prior to actual distribution, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant’s or any other person’s bankruptcy or insolvency. 8.6 Employment Not Guaranteed.Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any employee any right to be retained in the employ of an Employer or to serve as a director. 8.7 Errors.At any time AT&T or an Employer may correct any error made under the Plan without prejudice to AT&T or any Employer. Neither AT&T nor any Employer shall be liable for any damages resulting from failure to timely allow any contribution to be made to the Plan or for any damages resulting from the correction of, or a delay in correcting, any error made under the Plan. In no event shall AT&T or any Employer be liable for consequential or incidental damages arising out of a failure to comply with the terms of the Plan. 8.8 Captions.The captions of the articles, sections, and paragraphs of this Plan are for convenience only and shall not control nor affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions. 338.9 Governing Law.To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the Plan, and all benefits and agreements hereunder, and any and all disputes in connection therewith, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict or choice of law principles which might otherwise refer the construction, interpretation or enforceability of this Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Because benefits under the Plan are granted in Texas, records relating to the Plan and benefits thereunder are located in Texas, and the Plan and benefits thereunder are administered in Texas, AT&T and the Participant under this Plan, for themselves and their successors and assigns, irrevocably submit to the exclusive and sole jurisdiction and venue of the state or Federal courts of Texas with respect to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Plan, the subject matter of this Plan or any benefits under this Plan, including but not limited to any disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation and enforceability of any benefits or the terms and conditions of this Plan. To achieve certainty regarding the appropriate forum in which to prosecute and defend actions arising out of or relating to this Plan, and to ensure consistency in application and interpretation of the Governing Law to the Plan, the parties agree that (a) sole and exclusive appropriate venue for any such action shall be an appropriate Federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, and no other, (b) all claims with respect to any such action shall be heard and determined exclusively in such Texas court, and no other, (c) such Texas court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of any dispute relating hereto and (d) that the parties waive any and all objections and defenses to bringing any such action before such Texas court, including but not limited to those relating to lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue or forum non conveniens. 8.10 Plan to Comply with Section 409A.In the event any provision of this Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of this Plan. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, each provision in this Plan shall be interpreted to permit the deferral of compensation in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and any provision that would conflict with such requirements shall not be valid or enforceable. 8.11 Successors and Assigns.This Plan shall be binding upon AT&T and its successors and assigns. 34Attachment AEligibility CriteriaStock Purchase and Deferral Plan and Cash Deferral Plan (the “Plans”)Effective May 18, 2023The following criteria shall apply with respect to participation in the Plans, subject to all other requirements of the Plans:Management Employees who are “third level or above managers” (as indicated by a job level indicator of “3” or higher) or the equivalent, are eligible to participate in the Plans and shall be deemed to be included as members of “Employer's ‘select group of management or highly compensated employees’” for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

Conversions of Stock awards into Share Units and their eventual distribution (excluding the effects of any dividends on such Share Units) shall count only against the limits of the plans from which they originated and shall not be applied against the limits in this Plan. To the extent Share Units are credited through deferrals of Stock or Employee Contributions where the distribution of which would be deductible by AT&T under Section 162(m) of the Code without regard to the size of the distribution, and such deductible Share Units are available for distribution, such Share Units shall be distributed first. Page 9(b)In the event the Committee determines that continuing the issuance of Share Units under the Plan or Stock Options under the Plan may cause the number of shares of Stock that are to be distributed under this Plan or the number of Stock Options (as determined pursuant to Page 10subsection (a), above) to exceed the number of authorized shares of Stock, then in lieu of distributing Stock, the Committee may provide after such determination and only with respect to Share Units that have not theretofore been credited to a Share Deferral Account, that such Share Units may be settled in cash equal to the value of the Stock that would otherwise be distributed based on the FMV of the Stock on the date of the distribution of such Share Unit. The Committee may also provide after such determination and only with respect to Stock Options that have not theretofore been issued that such Stock Options may only be settled on a Net-Settled basis in cash equal to the value of the Stock that would otherwise be distributed based on the FMV of the Stock on the day of exercise. (c)In the event of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock dividend, stock split, share combination, or other change in the corporate structure of AT&T affecting the shares of Stock (including a conversion of Stock into cash or other property), such adjustment shall be made to the number and class of the shares of Stock which may be delivered under the Plan (including but not limited to individual limits), and in the number and class of and/or price of shares of Stock subject to outstanding Options granted under the Plan, and/or in the number of outstanding Options and Share Units, or such other adjustment determined by the Committee, in each case as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.3.3 Claims and Appeals.(a)Claims. A person who believes that he or she is being denied a benefit to which he or she is entitled under this Plan (hereinafter referred to as a “Claimant”) may file a written request for such benefit with the Executive Compensation Administration Department, setting forth his or her claim. The request must be addressed to the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department at its then principal place of business.(b)Claim Decision. Upon receipt of a claim, the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department shall review the claim and provide the Claimant with a written notice of its decision within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, after the claim is received. If the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department determines that special circumstances require an extension of time beyond the initial ninety (90)- day claim review period, the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department shall notify the Claimant in writing within the initial ninety (90)-day period and explain the special circumstances that require the extension and state the date by which the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department expects to render its decision on the claim. If this notice is provided, the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department may take up to an additional ninety (90) days (for a total of one hundred eighty (180) days after receipt of the claim) to render its decision on the claim. If the claim is denied by the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department, in whole or in part, the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department shall provide a written decision using language calculated to be understood by the Claimant and setting forth: (i) the specific reason or reasons for such denial; (ii) specific references to pertinent provisions of this Plan on which such denial is based; (iii) a description of any Page 11additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim and an explanation of why such material or Page 12such information is necessary; (iv) a description of the Plan’s procedures for review of denied claims and the steps to be taken if the Claimant wishes to submit the claim for review; (v) the time limits for requesting a review of a denied claim under this section and for conducting the review under this section; and (vi) a statement of the Claimant’s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA if the claim is denied following review under this section. (c)Request for Review. Within sixty (60) days after the receipt by the Claimant of the written decision on the claim provided for in this section, the Claimant may request in writing that the Committee review the determination of the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department. Such request must be addressed to the Committee at the address for giving notice in this Plan. To assist the Claimant in deciding whether to request a review of a denied claim or in preparing a request for review of a denied claim, a Claimant shall be provided, upon written request to the Committee and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. The Claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may, but need not, submit a statement of the issues and comments in writing, as well as other documents, records or other information relating to the claim for consideration by the Committee. If the Claimant does not request a review by the Committee of the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department’s decision within such sixty (60)-day period, the Claimant shall be barred and stopped from challenging the determination of the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department. (d)Review of Decision. Within sixty (60) days after the Committee’s receipt of a request for review, the Administrator will review the decision of the AT&T Executive Compensation Administration Department. If the Committee determines that special circumstances require an extension of time beyond the initial sixty (60)-day review period, the Committee shall notify the Claimant in writing within the initial sixty (60)-day period and explain the special circumstances that require the extension and state the date by which the Committee expects to render its decision on the review of the claim. If this notice is provided, the Committee may take up to an additional sixty (60) days (for a total of one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request for review) to render its decision on the review of the claim. During its review of the claim, the Committee shall:(1) Take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial review of the claim conducted pursuant to this section;(2) Follow reasonable procedures to verify that its benefit determination is made in accordance with the applicable Plan documents; and(3) Follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the applicable Plan provisions are applied to the Participant to whom the claim relates in a manner consistent with how such provisions have been applied to other similarly-situated Participants. After considering all materials presented by the Claimant, the Committee will render a decision, written in a manner designed to be understood by the Claimant. If the Page 13Committee denies the claim on review, the written decision will include (i) the specific reasons for the decision; (ii) specific references to the pertinent provisions of this Plan on which the decision is based; (iii) a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request to the Committee and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claim; and (iv) a statement of the Claimant’s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. The Committee shall serve as the final review committee under the Plan and shall have sole and complete discretionary authority to administer, interpret, construe and apply the Plan provisions, and determine all questions of administration, interpretation, construction, and application of the Plan, including questions and determinations of eligibility, entitlement to benefits and the type, form and amount of any payment of benefits, all in its sole and absolute discretion. The Committee shall further have the authority to determine all relevant facts and related issues, and all documents, records and other information relevant to a claim conclusively for all parties, and in accordance with the terms of the documents or instruments governing the Plan. Decisions by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all parties and not subject to further review. In any case, a Participant or Beneficiary may have further rights under ERISA. The Plan provisions require that Participants or Beneficiary pursue all claim and appeal rights described in this section before they seek any other legal recourse regarding claims for benefits. Article 4 - Contributions4.1 Election to Make Contributions. (a)The Committee shall establish dates and other conditions for participation in the Plan and making contributions as it deems appropriate. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, each year an Employee who is an Eligible Employee as of September 30 may thereafter make an election on or prior to the last Business Day of the immediately following November (such election shall be cancelled if the Employee is not an Eligible Employee on the last day such an election may be made) to contribute on a pre-tax basis, through payroll deductions, any combination of the following:(1)From 6% to 30% (in whole percentage increments) of the Participant’s monthly Base Compensation, other than Annual Bonus, during the calendar year (the Plan Year for such contributions) following the calendar year of such election. The Employee Contributions shall be used to acquire Share Units to be credited to the Share Deferral Account for that Plan Year. (2)Up to 95% (in whole percentage increments or limited to the target amount) of a Short Term Incentive Award, or from 6% to 30% (in whole percentage increments) of Annual Bonus, in each case such contributions shall be made during the second calendar year (which is the Plan Year for such contributions) following the year of such election, except that in 2008 a separate election may be made with respect to contributions to be made in 2009. An Employee may make such an election with respect to the type of Award (Short Term Incentive Award or Annual Bonus) that the Employee is under as of the time the Employee’s eligibility to make such election is determined. If because of a promotion or otherwise, the Employee receives a different type of Award instead of, or in partial or full replacement for, the type of Award subject to the Page 14Employee’s election for the relevant Plan Year, the election will apply to the other Award as well, including but not limited to any individual discretionary award related thereto. Page 15(b)The Committee may permit an Eligible Employee to make an election to purchase Share Units under this Plan with compensation other than Base Compensation or Short Term Incentive Awards on such terms and conditions as such Committee may permit from time to time, provided that any such election is made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. In no event shall an acquisition of Share Units pursuant to this paragraph (b) or pursuant to the conversion of a right to receive Stock into Share Units (such as through a distribution of Stock under the 2001 Incentive Plan) result in the crediting of an AT&T Matching Contribution or Options.(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, no election shall be effective to the extent it would permit an Employee Contribution or distribution to be made that is not in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent such election related to Employee Contributions that complied with such statute and regulations thereunder, that portion of the election shall remain valid, except as otherwise provided under this Plan. (d)To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, AT&T may refuse or terminate, in whole or in part, any election to purchase Share Units in the Plan at any time; provided, however, that only the Committee may take such action with respect to persons who are Officer Level Employees.4.2 Purchase of Share Units. (a)Employee Contributions (as well as any corresponding AT&T Matching Contributions) shall be made pursuant to a proper election, only during the Participant’s lifetime; provided, however, with respect to Employee Contribution elections made prior to 2007, the Employee must remain an Eligible Employee while making any such contributions. In the event of a Change in Control of an Employer, subsequent compensation from the Employer may not be contributed to the Plan. The Employer may continue the then current elections of the participants under a subsequent plan in order to comply with applicable tax laws. (b)The number of Share Units purchased by a Participant during a calendar month shall be found by dividing the Participant's Employee Contributions during the month by the FMV of a share of Stock on the last day of such month.(c)A contribution to the Plan shall be made when the compensation – from which the contribution is to be deducted – is to be paid (“paid,” as used in this Plan, includes amounts contributed to the Plan that would have been paid were it not for an election under this Plan), as determined by the relevant Employer. The Committee may modify or change this paragraph (c) from time to time. 4.3 Reinvestment of Dividends. In the month containing a record date for a cash dividend on Stock, each Share Deferral Account shall be credited with that number of Share Units equal to the declared dividend per share of Stock, multiplied by the number of Share Units held in such Share Deferral Account as of such record date, and dividing the product by the FMV of a share of Stock on the last day of such month. Page 16Page 17Article 5 - AT&T Matching Contributions5.1 AT&T Match. (a)Each month AT&T shall credit the Participant's relevant Share Deferral Account with the number of “Matching Share Units” found by taking the percentage of company matching contribution that the Employee is eligible to receive under the AT&T Retirement Savings Plan (or such other 401(k) plan of an Employer that the Employee is eligible to participate in) multiplied by the Participant's Employee Contributions from Base Compensation made to this Plan and to the Cash Deferral Plan during the month with respect to the first six percent (6%) of the Participant’s monthly Match Eligible Compensation (as defined below) and dividing the resulting figure by the FMV of the Stock on the last day of such month (such resulting amount shall be the “Matching Contribution”). The monthly “Match Eligible Compensation” shall be the sum of:(1) the monthly Employee Contributions from Base Compensation to this Plan and the Cash Deferral Plan (in the aggregate, “Deferred BC”), plus (2) the amount of the Participant’s monthly Base Compensation in excess of the Deferred BC (“Non-Deferred BC”) but only to the extent such monthly Non-Deferred BC, when aggregated with the Participant’s total Non-Deferred BC for prior months in such Plan Year, as determined by the relevant Employer, exceeds the limit in effect under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code applicable with respect to such Plan Year. The foregoing formula shall apply regardless of whether or not the Participant makes contributions to a 401(k) plan. A Participant may receive Matching Share Units in a Share Deferral Account for a particular form of compensation only if the Participant is then making contributions to the same Share Deferral Account; provided, however, this condition shall not apply for purposes of determining under Section 5.1(a)(2) whether the limit described therein has been reached.As provided in the definition of Share Deferral Account, Matching Share Units shall be credited to the respective Share Deferral Account that is related to the same form of Employee Contributions (either (1) Base Compensation excluding Annual Bonus or (2) Annual Bonus). (b)In the sole discretion of the Committee, in the event the Committee reduces the number of Options that AT&T issues for each Share Unit purchased, the Committee may provide for the contribution of a Bonus Matching Contribution on such terms as the Committee determines. Such Bonus Matching Contribution may not exceed 20% of the Participant’s Employee Contributions for the month. The Bonus Matching Contribution shall be subject to such terms and conditions as required by the Committee and, unless otherwise provided by the Committee, to the same distribution requirements as Matching Contributions. Pursuant to the foregoing authority and until otherwise provided by the Committee, effective for Share Accounts created pursuant to Employee Contribution elections where such elections are made after January 1, 2010, AT&T shall make Bonus Matching Contributions equal to 20% of the Participant’s monthly Employee Contributions from each of Base Compensation and Short Term Incentive Award (not to exceed the target amount of such award, which limit shall be pro rated for any Page 18partial year award). Such Bonus Matching Contribution shall be used to purchase that number of Matching Share Units Page 19found by dividing the relevant Bonus Matching Contribution for the month by the FMV of the Stock on the last day of such month.5.2 Distribution of Share Units Acquired with Matching Contributions. A Participant's Matching Share Units shall be distributed in a lump sum, in accordance with the Plan's distribution provisions, in the earlier of: (a) the calendar year following the calendar year of the Termination of Employment of the Participant, or (b) the calendar year in which the Participant reaches age 55, in each case only with respect to Matching Share Units relating to Share Deferral Accounts for Plan Years before such distribution calendar year. Matching Share Units acquired as part of a Share Deferral Account that commences in or after the calendar year the Employee reaches age 55 or after the calendar year in which the Employee Terminates Employment will be distributed in the same manner and time as other Share Units in such Share Deferral Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, Matching Share Units acquired in 2008 and later shall be distributed at the same time as other Share Units (including those acquired with Employee Contributions) in the same Share Deferral Account. Article 6 - Distributions6.1 Distributions of Share Units. (a)Initial Election with Respect to a Share Deferral Account. At the time the Participant makes an election to make Employee Contributions with respect to a Share Deferral Account, the Participant shall also elect the calendar year the Share Deferral Account shall be distributed, which may be from the first through fifth calendar years after the Plan Year the Account commenced (except as otherwise provided in this Plan with respect to Matching Share Units). For example, if an Account commenced in 2005, the Participant may elect to commence the distribution in any calendar year from and including 2006 to and including 2010. If no timely distribution election is made by the Participant, then the Participant will be deemed to have made an election to have the Share Deferral Account distributed in a single installment in the first calendar year after the calendar year the Account commenced. (b)Election to Delay a Scheduled Distribution. (i)An Employee may elect to defer a scheduled distribution of a Share Deferral Account for five (5) or more additional calendar years beyond that previously elected (except as otherwise provided in this Plan with respect to Matching Share Units). Unless otherwise provided by AT&T, the election to defer the distribution must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the scheduled distribution date. (ii)To make this election, the Participant must be an Employee on the day of such election. (iii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan: Page 20a.an election to defer the distribution of a Share Deferral Account must be made at least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under the prior distribution election, and b.the election shall not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made.Page 21(c)A Participant’s Share Deferral Account shall be distributed to the Participant on March 10 (or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable as determined by AT&T) of the calendar year elected by the Participant for that Account. In the event the distribution is to be made to a “Specified Employee” as a result of the Participant’s Termination of Employment (other than as a result of a Change in Control), the distribution shall not occur until the later of such March 10 or six (6) months after the Termination of Employment, except it shall be distributed upon the Participant’s earlier death in accordance with this Plan.6.2 Death of the Participant.In the event of the death of a Participant, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, all undistributed Share Deferral Accounts shall be distributed to the Participant's beneficiary in accordance with the AT&T Rules for Employee Beneficiary Designations, as the same may be amended from time to time, within the later of 90 days following such determination or the end of the calendar year in which determination was made.6.3 Unforeseeable Emergency Distribution.If a Participant experiences an “Unforeseeable Emergency,” the Participant may submit a written petition to AT&T (the Committee in the case of Officer Level Employees), to receive a partial or full distribution of his Share Deferral Account(s). In the event that AT&T (the Committee in the case of Officer Level Employees), upon review of the written petition of the Participant, determines in its sole discretion that the Participant has suffered an “Unforeseeable Emergency,” AT&T shall make a distribution to the Participant from the Participant’s Share Deferral Accounts (other than Matching Share Units), on a pro-rata basis, within the later of 90 days following such determination or the end of the calendar year in which determination was made, subject to the following:(a)“Unforeseeable Emergency” shall mean a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant’s legal spouse, the Participant’s beneficiary, or the Participant’s dependent (as defined in Code Section 152, without regard to Code Section 152(b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B)); loss of the Participant’s property due to casualty; or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant, all as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Whether a Participant is faced with an Unforeseeable Emergency permitting a distribution is to be determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances of each case, but, in any case, a distribution on account of Unforeseeable Emergency shall not be made to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant’s assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship, or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. (b)The amount of a distribution to be made because of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the FMV of the Participant's vested Share Deferral Account, calculated as the date on which the amount becomes payable, as determined by AT&T (the Committee in the case of Officer Level Employees) in its sole discretion, and (ii) the amount Page 22reasonably necessary, as determined by the AT&T (the Committee in the case of Officer Level Employees) in its sole discretion, to satisfy the emergency need (which may include amounts Page 23necessary to pay any Federal, state, local, or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution). Determinations of the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need shall take into account any additional compensation that is available if the plan provides for cancellation of a deferral election upon a payment due to an Unforeseeable Emergency. The determination of amounts reasonably necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency need is not required to, but may, take into account any additional compensation that, due to the Unforeseeable Emergency, is available under another nonqualified deferred compensation plan but has not actually been paid, or that is available due to the Unforeseeable Emergency under another plan that would provide for deferred compensation except due to the application of the effective date provisions under Treasury Regulation §1.409A-6. (c)Upon such distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency under this Plan, any election to make Employee Contributions by such Participant shall be immediately cancelled, and the Participant shall not be permitted to make a new election with respect to Employee Contributions that would be contributed during the then current and immediately following calendar year.6.4 Ineligible Participant. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan to the contrary, if AT&T receives an opinion from counsel selected by AT&T, or a final determination is made by a Federal, state or local government or agency, acting within its scope of authority, to the effect that an individual’s continued participation in the Plan would violate applicable law, then such person shall not make further contributions to the Plan to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code. 6.5 Conflict of Interest Distribution.AT&T may in its sole discretion accelerate a distribution(s) to the Participant, provided he or she is no longer actively employed by AT&T: (a) to the extent necessary for any Federal officer or employee in the executive branch to comply with an ethics agreement with the Federal government or (b) to the extent reasonably necessary to avoid the violation of an applicable Federal, state, local, or foreign ethics law or conflicts of interest law (including where such payment is reasonably necessary to permit the service provider to participate in activities in the normal course of his or her position in which the service provider would otherwise not be able to participate under an applicable rule). Any such distribution may only be made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder.6.6 Distribution Process. A Share Deferral Account shall be distributed under this Plan by taking the number of Share Units comprising the Account to be distributed and converting them into an equal number of shares of Stock. (Once distributed, a Share Unit shall be canceled.) Page 24Article 7 - Transition Provisions7.1 Stockholder Approval The Plan was approved by Stockholders at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 7.2 2005 Share Deferral Accounts. Notwithstanding Article 4 to the contrary, if an Employee is an Eligible Employee on September 30, 2004, the Employee may make an election under Article 4 on or prior to December 15, 2004, with respect to the establishment of a Share Deferral Account for the (i) contribution of Base Compensation and/or Short Term Incentive Awards paid during the period from January 1, 2005, through January 15, 2006, which shall be the Plan Year for such Share Deferral Account; and/or (ii) the conversion of a distribution of Stock that would be made during the same Plan Year pursuant to the 2001 Incentive Plan into an equal number of Share Units, so long as such conversion would not cause the recognition of income for Federal income tax purposes in respect of such distribution of Stock prior to distribution of Share Units under this Plan.7.3 2007 Amendments.(a)Amendments made to the Plan on November 15, 2007, shall be effective January 1, 2008. except for amendments to this Article 7, which shall be effective upon adoption. Any Participants electing prior to November 15, 2007, to make Employee Contributions in 2008 shall have their elections canceled if they do not consent by December 14, 2007, to all prior amendments to this Plan and to the Cash Deferral Plan. Subject to the foregoing consent requirements, all Employee Contribution elections made prior to 2008, including but not limited to elections to contribute Stock that would be distributed under the 2001 Incentive Plan or a successor plan, shall remain in force, subject to all other terms of the amended Plan. In addition, all unvested but not forfeited Matching Share Units shall vest on November 15, 2007. Matching Shares that have been forfeited shall not be reinstated, and no amendment to this Plan shall be interpreted as reinstating such forfeitures. (b)Not withstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, a Participant who as of December 29, 2006, was eligible for an additional payment pursuant to Section 4A of the BellSouth Corporation Executive Incentive Award Deferral Plan shall not, with respect to the 2008 Plan Year, receive Matching Share Units on Base Compensation that exceeds $230,000.7.4 2008 Amendments.For Plan Years prior to 2009, Participants who, at the time of the determination of their eligibility to participate in an Account, are paid through a “sales plan” involving the use of commissions may elect to contribute up to 40% of Base Compensation. For the 2008 Plan Year, only Salary and Short Term Incentive Awards paid after Termination of Employment may be contributed to the Plan.Page 25Article 8 - Options8.1 Grants. Options may be issued in definitive form or recorded on the books and records of AT&T for the account of the Participant, at the discretion of AT&T. If AT&T elects not to issue the Options in definitive form, they shall be deemed issued, and the Participants shall have all rights incident thereto as if they were issued on the dates provided herein, without further action on the part of AT&T or the Participant. In addition to the terms herein, all Options shall be subject to such additional provisions and limitations as provided in any Administrative Procedures adopted by the Committee prior to the issuance of such Options. The number of Options issued to a Participant shall be reflected on the Participant's annual statement of account.8.2 Term of Options.The Options may only be exercised: (a) after the earlier of (i) the expiration of one (1) year from date of issue or (ii) the Participant's Termination of Employment, and (b) no later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of their issue; and Options shall be subject to earlier termination as provided herein. 8.3 Exercise Price.The Exercise Price of an Option shall be the FMV of the Stock on the date of issuance of the Option, and an Option may not be repriced. 8.4 Issuance of Options. (a)For each Share Deferral Account established by a Participant pursuant to an Employee Contribution election where such election was made prior to January 1, 2010:(1) on June 15 of the Plan Year for the Share Deferral Account, the Participant shall receive two (2) Options for each Share Unit acquired by the Participant as part of such Share Deferral Account during the immediately preceding January through May period with Employee Contributions of Base Compensation and/or Short Term Incentive Award. A fractional number of Options shall be rounded up to the next whole number.(2) on the February 15 immediately following the Plan Year for the Share Deferral Account, a Participant shall receive:(i)two (2) Options for each Share Unit acquired by the Participant as part of such Share Deferral Account during the immediately preceding June through the remainder of the relevant Plan Year with Employee Contributions of Base Compensation and/or Short Term Incentive Award; and(ii) two (2) Options for each Share Unit acquired prior to such date by the Participant with dividend equivalents that were derived, directly or indirectly (such as dividend equivalents paid on Share Units acquired with dividend Page 26equivalents), from Share Units acquired with Employee Contributions as part of such Share Deferral Account. Page 27(b)A fractional number of Options shall be rounded up to the next whole number.(c)If Stock is not traded on the NYSE on any of the foregoing Option issuance dates, then the Options shall not be issued until the next such day on which Stock is so traded.(d)If a Participant Terminates Employment other than (i) while Retirement eligible or (ii) because of death or Disability, no further Options shall be issued to or with respect to such Participant. In the event of re-Employment following a Termination of Employment, the preceding sentence shall not apply to those Options resulting from participation in the Plan after such re-Employment until a subsequent Termination of Employment.(e)No more than 400,000 Options shall be issued to any individual under this Plan during a calendar year. No Share Unit may be counted more than once for the issuance of Options. (f)The Committee may, in its sole discretion, at any time, increase or lower the number of Options that are to be issued for each Share Unit acquired, not to exceed two (2) Options per Share Unit purchased. However, if the Committee lowers the number of Options, then such change shall only be effective with respect to the next Share Deferral Account a Participant may elect to establish. (g)The Committee may also, at any time and in any manner, limit the number of Options which may be acquired as a result of the Short Term Incentive Award being contributed to the Plan. Further, except as otherwise provided by the Committee, in determining the number of Options to be issued to a Participant with respect to a Participant's contribution of a Short Term Incentive Award to the Plan and subsequent crediting of Share Units, Options may be issued only with respect to an amount which does not exceed the target amount of such award (or such other portion of the award as may be determined by the Committee). Where a Participant’s election to contribute a Short Term Incentive Award to the Plan becomes applicable to Annual Bonus, the above limitation on options shall apply to the contribution of Annual Bonus as though it were a Short Term Incentive Award. (h)No options shall be issued to or in respect of a Participant for a particular issuance, unless at least ten (10) Options will be issued to that Participant. 8.5 Exercise and Payment of Options.Options shall be exercised by providing notice to the designated agent selected by AT&T (if no such agent has been designated, then to AT&T), in the manner and form determined by AT&T, which notice shall be irrevocable, setting forth the exact number of shares of Stock with respect to which the Option is being exercised and including with such notice payment of the Exercise Price. When Options have been transferred, AT&T or its designated agent may require appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the Option, if other than the Participant, has the right to exercise the Option. No Option may be exercised with respect to a fraction of a share of Stock. Page 28Exercises of Options may be effected only on days and during the hours that the New York Stock Exchange is open for regular trading or as otherwise provided or limited by AT&T. If an Option expires on a day or at a time when exercises are not permitted, then the Options may be exercised no later than the immediately preceding date and time that the Options were exercisable. The Exercise Price shall be paid in full at the time of exercise. No Stock shall be issued or transferred until full payment has been received therefore.Payment may be made:(a) in cash, or(b) unless otherwise provided by the Committee at any time, and subject to such additional terms and conditions and/or modifications as AT&T may impose from time to time, and further subject to suspension or termination of this provision by AT&T at any time, by:(i) electing a Stock-Settled Exercise on or after February 1, 2013. Upon exercise of Options through a Stock-Settled Exercise, the Participant shall receive that number of shares of Stock found by (1) subtracting the Exercise Price of an Option being exercised (on a per share basis) from the FMV of the Stock as of the immediately preceding day that the Stock was traded on the NYSE, (2) multiplying the difference by the number of Options being exercised, and (3) dividing the result by the same FMV. For example, a Participant exercises 1,000 Options with an Exercise Price of $30 (exercises may only occur on a day when the NYSE is open for regular trading) and the FMV for the immediately preceding trading day was $40. In that case, the Participant would receive his $10,000 profit in the form of 250 shares of Stock, subject to tax withholding and any other costs provided under this Plan.or;(ii) if AT&T has designated a stockbroker to act as AT&T's agent to process Option exercises, issuance of an exercise notice to such stockbroker together with instructions irrevocably instructing the stockbroker: (A) to immediately sell (which shall include an exercise notice that becomes effective upon execution of a sell order) a sufficient portion of the Stock to pay the Exercise Price of the Options being exercised and the required tax withholding, and (B) to deliver on the settlement date the portion of the proceeds of the sale equal to the Exercise Price and tax withholding to AT&T. In the event the stockbroker sells any Stock on behalf of a Participant, the stockbroker shall be acting solely as the agent of the Participant, and AT&T disclaims any responsibility for the actions of the stockbroker in making any such sales. No Stock shall be issued until the settlement date and until the proceeds (equal to the Exercise Price and tax withholding) are paid to AT&T.8.6 Restrictions on Exercise and Transfer. Page 29No Option shall be transferable except: (a) upon the death of a Participant in accordance with AT&T's Rules for Employee Beneficiary Designations, as the same may be amended from time to time; and (b) in the case of any holder after the Participant's death, only by will or by the Page 30laws of descent and distribution. During the Participant's lifetime, the Participant's Options shall be exercisable only by the Participant or by the Participant's guardian or legal representative. After the death of the Participant, an Option shall only be exercised by the holder thereof (including but not limited to an executor or administrator of a decedent's estate) or his or her guardian or legal representative. In each such case the Option holder shall be considered a Participant for the limited purpose of exercising such Options. 8.7 Termination of Employment. (a)Not Retirement Eligible. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, if a Participant Terminates Employment while not Retirement eligible, a Participant's Options may be exercised, to the extent then exercisable: (i) if such Termination of Employment is by reason of death or Disability, then for a period of three (3) years from the date of such Termination of Employment or until the expiration of the stated term of such Option, whichever period is shorter; or(ii) if such Termination of Employment is for any other reason, then for a period of one (1) year from the date of such Termination of Employment or until the expiration of the stated term of such Option, whichever period is shorter.(b)Retirement Eligible. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, if a Participant Terminates Employment while Retirement eligible, the Participant's Option may be exercised, to the extent then exercisable: (i) for a period of five (5) years from the date of Retirement or (ii) until the expiration of the stated term of such Option, whichever period is shorter. (c)Re-Employment of a Participant after a Termination of Employment shall have no effect on the periods during which Options resulting from the prior Employment may be exercised. For example, if the Option exercise period has been shortened because of the prior Termination of Employment, it shall not be extended because of the re-Employment. (d)Notwithstanding any other definition of Termination of Employment under this Plan, for purposes of this Article 8 – Options only, a Termination of Employment shall mean the cessation of the Employee being employed by any corporation, partnership, venture or other entity in which AT&T holds, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater ownership interest, including but not limited to where AT&T ceases to hold such interest in the employing company. In addition, the definition of Retirement for purposes of this Article 8 shall use the immediately foregoing definition of Termination of Employment in lieu of any other definition. Article 9 - Discontinuation, Termination, Amendment.9.1 AT&T's Right to Discontinue Offering Share Units. The Committee may at any time discontinue offerings of Share Units under the Plan. Any such discontinuance shall have no effect upon existing Share Units or the terms or provisions of this Plan as applicable to such Share Units. Page 31Page 329.2 AT&T's Right to Terminate Plan. The Committee may terminate the Plan at any time. Upon termination of the Plan, contributions shall no longer be made under the Plan.After termination of the Plan, Participants shall continue to earn dividend equivalents in the form of Share Units on undistributed Share Units and shall continue to receive all distributions under this Plan at such time as provided in and pursuant to the terms and conditions of Participant's elections and this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of the Plan shall be made solely in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and in no event shall cause the accelerated distribution of any Account unless such termination is effected in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. 9.3 Amendment.The Committee may at any time amend the Plan in whole or in part including but not limited to changing the formulas for determining the amount of AT&T Matching Contributions under Article 5 or decreasing the number of Options to be issued under Article 8; provided, however, that no amendment, including but not limited to an amendment to this section, shall be effective, without the consent of a Participant, to alter, to the material detriment of such Participant, a Share Deferral Account of the Participant, other than as provided elsewhere in this section. For purposes of this section, an alteration to the material detriment of a Participant shall include, but not be limited to, a material reduction in the period of time over which Stock may be distributed to a Participant, any reduction in the Participant's number of vested Share Units or Options, or an increase in the Exercise Price or decrease in the term of an Option. Any such consent may be in a writing, telecopy, or e-mail or in another electronic format. An election to acquire Share Units with Employee Contributions shall be conclusively deemed to be the consent of the Participant to any and all amendments to the Plan prior to such election, and such consent shall be a condition to making any election with respect to Employee Contributions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section of the Plan, the Committee may modify this Plan with respect to any person subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) to place additional restrictions on the exercise of any Option or the transfer of any Stock not yet issued under the Plan.

The Company also reserves the right to make such other changes as may facilitate implementation of Section 409A of the Code. Provided, however, that in no event shall any such amendments be made in violation of the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.Page 33Article 10 – Miscellaneous.10.1 Tax Withholding.Upon distribution of Stock, including but not limited to, shares of Stock issued upon the exercise of an Option, AT&T shall withhold shares of Stock sufficient in value, using the FMV on the date determined by AT&T to be used to value the Stock for tax purposes, to satisfy the minimum amount of Federal, state, and local taxes required by law to be withheld as a result of such distribution. Employment taxes incurred by a Participant on Employee Contributions and on Matching Contributions shall be withheld from the Participant’s regular wages or paid in cash by the Participant as they become due.Any fractional share of Stock payable to a Participant shall be withheld as additional Federal withholding, or, at the option of AT&T, paid in cash to the Participant. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, when the method of payment for the Exercise Price is from the sale by a stockbroker pursuant to Section 8.5, hereof, of the Stock acquired through the Option exercise, then the tax withholding shall be satisfied out of the proceeds. For administrative purposes in determining the amount of taxes due, the sale price of such Stock shall be deemed to be the FMV of the Stock. 10.2 Elections and Notices.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, all elections and notices of every kind under this Plan shall be made (1) on forms prepared by AT&T or the General Counsel, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, or their respective delegates, or (2) in such other manner as permitted or required by AT&T or the General Counsel, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, or their respective delegates, including through electronic means, over the Internet or otherwise.

Unless made irrevocable by the electing person, each election with regard to making Employee Contributions or distributions of Share Deferral Accounts shall become irrevocable at the close of business on the last day the Employee is permitted to make such election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, AT&T may place additional limits on the times during which elections may be made to make contribution(s) or to delay distribution(s). If not otherwise specified by this Plan or AT&T, any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to AT&T under the Plan shall be delivered to the principal office of AT&T, directed to the attention of the Senior Executive Vice President in charge of Human Resources for AT&T or his or her successor. Such notice shall be deemed given on the date of delivery.Notice to the Participant shall be deemed given when mailed (or sent by telecopy) to the Participant's work or home address as shown on the records of AT&T or, at the option of AT&T, to the Participant's e-mail address as shown on the records of AT&T. It is the Participant's responsibility to ensure that the Participant's addresses are kept up to date on the records of Page 34AT&T. In the case of notices affecting multiple Participants, the notices may be given by general distribution at the Participants' work locations.Page 35By participating in the Plan, each Participant agrees that AT&T may provide any documents required or permitted under the Federal or state securities laws, including but not limited to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by e-mail, by e-mail attachment, or by notice by e-mail of electronic delivery through AT&T's Internet Web site or by other electronic means.10.3 Unsecured General Creditor.Participants and their beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interest, or claims in any property or assets of any Employer. No assets of any Employer shall be held under any trust for the benefit of Participants, their beneficiaries, heirs, successors, or assigns, or held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of any Employer under this Plan. Any and all of each Employer's assets shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of such Employer. The only obligation of an Employer under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of AT&T to distribute shares of Stock corresponding to Share Units and Options, under the Plan. 10.4 Non-Assignability.Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt, shares of Stock corresponding to Share Units under the Plan, if any, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the Stock distributable shall, prior to actual distribution, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.10.5 Employment Not Guaranteed. Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any employee any right to be retained in the employ of an Employer or to serve as a director.10.6 Errors.At any time AT&T or an Employer may correct any error made under the Plan without prejudice to AT&T or any Employer. Neither AT&T nor any Employer shall be liable for any damages resulting from failure to timely allow any contribution to be made to the Plan or for any damages resulting from the correction of, or a delay in correcting, any error made under the Plan. In no event shall AT&T or any Employer be liable for consequential or incidental damages arising out of a failure to comply with the terms of the Plan. 10.7 Captions. The captions of the articles, sections, and paragraphs of this Plan are for convenience only and shall not control nor affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.Page 36Page 3710.8 Governing Law.To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the Plan, and all benefits and agreements hereunder, and any and all disputes in connection therewith, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict or choice of law principles which might otherwise refer the construction, interpretation or enforceability of this Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Because benefits under the Plan are granted in Texas, records relating to the Plan and benefits thereunder are located in Texas, and the Plan and benefits thereunder are administered in Texas, AT&T and the Participant under this Plan, for themselves and their successors and assigns, irrevocably submit to the exclusive and sole jurisdiction and venue of the state or Federal courts of Texas with respect to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Plan, the subject matter of this Plan or any benefits under this Plan, including but not limited to any disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation and enforceability of any benefits or the terms and conditions of this Plan. To achieve certainty regarding the appropriate forum in which to prosecute and defend actions arising out of or relating to this Plan, and to ensure consistency in application and interpretation of the Governing Law to the Plan, the parties agree that (a) sole and exclusive appropriate venue for any such action shall be an appropriate Federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, and no other, (b) all claims with respect to any such action shall be heard and determined exclusively in such Texas court, and no other, (c) such Texas court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of any dispute relating hereto and (d) that the parties waive any and all objections and defenses to bringing any such action before such Texas court, including but not limited to those relating to lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue or forum non conveniens.10.9 Plan to Comply with Section 409A. In the event any provision of this Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of this Plan. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, each provision in this Plan shall be interpreted to permit the deferral of compensation in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and any provision that would conflict with such requirements shall not be valid or enforceable. 10.10 Successors and Assigns. This Plan shall be binding upon AT&T and its successors and assigns.10.11 Loyalty Conditions for Officer Level Employees and Senior ManagersEach Officer Level Employee or a Senior Manager who elects to make Employee Contributions under Section 4.1 of this Plan shall be subject to the agreements and conditions of this section.

Accordingly, as a condition to making anPage 39▪Employee Contribution election under Section 4.1 of this Plan after September 1, 2009, each such electing Participant is deemed to agree that he shall not, without obtaining the written consent of the Committee in advance, participate in activities that constitute engaging in competition with AT&T or engaging in conduct disloyal to AT&T, as those terms are defined in this section. (b)Definitions. For purposes of this section and of the Plan generally:(i)an “Employer Business” shall mean AT&T Inc. and any of its Subsidiaries, or any business in which they or any affiliate of theirs has a substantial ownership or joint venture interest; (ii)“engaging in competition with AT&T” shall mean, while employed by AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries, or within two (2) years after Participant’s Termination of Employment, engaging by the Participant in any business or activity in all or any portion of the same geographical market where the same or substantially similar business or activity is being carried on by an Employer Business. “Engaging in competition with AT&T” shall not include owning a non-substantial publicly traded interest as a shareholder in a business that competes with an Employer Business. “Engaging in competition with AT&T” shall include representing or providing consulting services to, or being an employee of, any person or entity that is engaged in competition with any Employer Business or that takes a position adverse to any Employer Business. (iii)“engaging in conduct disloyal to AT&T” means, while employed by AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries, or within two (2) years after Participant’s Termination of Employment, (i) soliciting for employment or hire, whether as an employee or as an independent contractor, for any business in competition with an Employer Business, any person employed by AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries during the one (1) year prior to the Participant’s Termination of Employment, whether or not acceptance of such position would constitute a breach of such person’s contractual obligations to AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) soliciting, encouraging, or inducing any vendor or supplier with which Participant had business contact on behalf of any Employer Business during the two (2) years prior to the Participant’s Termination of Employment (regardless of the reason for that termination) to terminate, discontinue, renegotiate, reduce, or otherwise cease or modify its relationship with AT&T or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) soliciting, encouraging, or inducing any customer or active prospective customer with whom Participant had business contact, whether in person or by other media (“Customer”), on behalf of any Employer Business during the two (2) years prior to the Participant’s Termination of Employment (regardless of the reason for that termination), to terminate, discontinue, renegotiate, reduce, or otherwise cease or modify its relationship with any Employer Business, or to purchase competing goods or services from a business competing with any Employer Business, or accepting or servicing business from such Customer on behalf of himself or any other business. “Engaging in conduct disloyal to AT&T” shall also mean, disclosing Confidential Information to any third party or using Confidential Page 40Information, other than for an Employer Business, or failing to return any Confidential Information to the Employer Business following termination of employment.Page 41(iv)“Confidential Information” shall mean all information belonging to, or otherwise relating to, an Employer Business, which is not generally known, regardless of the manner in which it is stored or conveyed to Participant, and which the Employer Business has taken reasonable measures under the circumstances to protect from unauthorized use or disclosure. Confidential Information includes trade secrets as well as other proprietary knowledge, information, know-how, and non-public intellectual property rights, including unpublished or pending patent applications and all related patent rights, formulae, processes, discoveries, improvements, ideas, conceptions, compilations of data, and data, whether or not patentable or copyrightable and whether or not it has been conceived, originated, discovered, or developed in whole or in part by Participant. For example, Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, information concerning the Employer Business’ business plans, budgets, operations, products, strategies, marketing, sales, inventions, designs, costs, legal strategies, finances, employees, customers, prospective customers, licensees, or licensors; information received from third parties under confidential conditions; or other valuable financial, commercial, business, technical or marketing information concerning the Employer Business, or any of the products or services made, developed or sold by the Employer Business. Confidential Information does not include information that (i) was generally known to the public at the time of disclosure; (ii) was lawfully received by Participant from a third party; (iii) was known to Participant prior to receipt from the Employer Business; or (iv) was independently developed by Participant or independent third parties; in each of the foregoing circumstances, this exception applies only if such public knowledge or possession by an independent third party was without breach by Participant or any third party of any obligation of confidentiality or non-use, including but not limited to the obligations and restrictions set forth in this Plan. (c)Equitable Relief. The parties recognize that any Participant’s breach of any of the covenants in this section will cause irreparable injury to the AT&T, will represent a failure of the consideration under which AT&T (in its capacity as creator and sponsor of the Plan) agreed to provide the Participant with the opportunity to receive Plan benefits, and that monetary damages would not provide AT&T with an adequate or complete remedy that would warrant AT&T’s continued sponsorship of the Plan (including the accrual or granting of Share Units, Matching Share Units and Options) for all Participants. Accordingly, in the event of a Participant’s actual or threatened breach of the covenants in this section, the Committee, in addition to all other rights and acting as a fiduciary under ERISA on behalf of all Participants, shall have a fiduciary duty (in order to assure that AT&T receives fair and promised consideration for its continued Plan sponsorship and funding) to seek an injunction restraining the Participant from breaching the covenants in this Section. AT&T shall pay for any Plan expenses that the Committee incurs hereunder, and shall be entitled to recover from the Participant its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in obtaining such injunctive remedies. (d)Uniform Enforcement. In recognition of AT&T’s need for nationally uniform standards for the Plan administration, it is an absolute condition in consideration of any Participant’s ability to make Employee Contribution elections under Section 4.1 of this Plan after Page 42September 1, 2009, that each and all of the following conditions apply to all such electing Participants: (i)ERISA shall control all issues and controversies hereunder, and the Committee shall serve for purposes hereof as a “fiduciary” of the Plan and its “named fiduciary” within the meaning of ERISA.(ii)All litigation between the parties relating to this section shall occur in federal court, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction; any such litigation shall be held in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, and the only remedies available with respect to the Plan shall be those provided under ERISA.

Accordingly, as a condition of receiving coverage and any Plan benefits on or after January 1, 2010, each Participant is deemed to agree that he/she shall not, without obtaining the written consent of the Plan Administrator in advance, participate in activities that constitute engaging in competition with AT&T or engaging in conduct disloyal to AT&T, as those terms are defined in this Section. Further and notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, all coverage and benefits under this Plan on and after January 1, 2010 with respect to a Participant and his or her Dependents shall be subject in their entirety to the enforcement provisions of this Section if the Participant, without the Plan Administrator’s consent, participates in an activity that constitutes engaging in competition with AT&T or engaging in conduct disloyal to AT&T, as defined below.

Confidential Information includes trade secrets as well as other proprietary knowledge, information, know-how, and non-public intellectual property rights, including unpublished or pending patent applications and all related patent rights, formulae, processes, discoveries, improvements, ideas, conceptions, compilations of data, and data, whether or not patentable or copyrightable and whether or not it has been conceived, originated, discovered, or developed in whole or in part by the Participant.

The parties recognize that any Participant’s breach of any of the covenants in this Article 8 will cause irreparable injury to AT&T, will represent a failure of the consideration under which AT&T (in its capacity as creator and sponsor of the Plan) agreed to provide the Participant with the opportunity to receive Plan coverage and benefits, and that monetary damages would not provide AT&T with an adequate or complete remedy that would warrant AT&T’s continued sponsorship of the Plan and payment of Plan benefits for all Participants. Accordingly, in the event of a Participant’s actual or threatened breach of the covenants in this Article, the Plan Administrator, in addition to all other rights and acting as a fiduciary under ERISA on behalf of all Participants, shall have a fiduciary duty (in order to assure that AT&T receives fair and promised consideration for its continued Plan sponsorship and funding) to seek an injunction restraining the Participant from breaching the covenants in this Article 8. In addition, AT&T shall pay for any Plan expenses that the Plan Administrator incurs hereunder, and shall be entitled to recover from the Participant its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in obtaining such injunctive remedies. To enforce its repayment rights with respect to a Participant, the Plan shall have a first priority, equitable lien on all Plan benefits provided to or for the Participant and his or her Dependents. In the event the Plan Administrator succeeds in enforcing the terms of this Article through a written settlement with the Participant or a court order granting an injunction hereunder, the Participant shall be entitled to collect Plan benefits collect Plan benefits prospectively, if the Participant is otherwise entitled to such benefits, net of any fees and costs assessed pursuant hereto (which fees and costs shall be paid to AT&T as a repayment on behalf of the Participant), provided that the Participant complies with said settlement or injunction.8.5Uniform Enforcement. In recognition of AT&T’s need for nationally uniform standards for the Plan administration, it is an absolute condition in consideration of any Participant’s accrual or receipt of benefits under the Plan after January 1, 2010 that each and all of the following conditions apply to all Participants and to any benefits that are paid or are payable under the Plan: (1)ERISA shall control all issues and controversies hereunder, and the Committee shall serve for purposes hereof as a “fiduciary” of the Plan, and as its “named fiduciary” within the meaning of ERISA.(2)All litigation between the parties relating to this Article shall occur in federal court, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction, any such litigation shall be held in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, and the only remedies available with respect to the Plan shall be those provided under ERISA.(3)If the Plan Administrator determines in its sole discretion either (I) that AT&T or its affiliate that employed the Participant terminated the Participant’s employment for cause, or (II) that equitable relief enforcing the Participant’s covenants under this Article 8 is either not reasonably available, not ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, or circumvented because the Participant has sued in state court, or has otherwise sought remedies not available under ERISA, then in any and all of such instances the Participant shall not be entitled to collect any Plan benefits, and if any Plan benefits have been paid to the, the Participant shall immediately repay all Plan benefits to the Plan (with such repayments being used within such year for increased benefits for other Participants in any manner determined in the Plan Administrator’s discretion) upon written demand from the Plan Administrator. Furthermore, the Participant shall hold AT&T and its affiliates harmless from any loss, expense, or damage that may arise from any of the conduct described in clauses (I) and (II) hereof.16ARTICLE 9 MISCELLANEOUS9.1Administration. The Plan Administrator is the named fiduciary of the Plan and has the power and duty to do all things necessary to carry out the terms of the Plan. The Plan Administrator has the sole and absolute discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan, to make findings of fact, to determine the rights and status of Participants and other under the Plan, to determine which expenses and benefits qualify as Covered Health Services or Covered Benefits, to make all benefit determinations under the Plan, to decide disputes under the Plan and to delegate all or a part of this discretion to third parties and insurers. To the fullest extent permitted by law, such interpretations, findings, determinations and decisions shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons for all purposes of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may delegate any or all of its authority and responsibility under the Plan to other individuals, committees, third party administrators, claims administrators or insurers for any purpose, including, but not limited to the processing of benefits and claims related thereto. In carrying out these functions, these individuals or entities have been delegated responsibility and discretion for interpreting the provisions of the Plan, making findings of fact, determining the rights and status of Participants and others under the Plan, and deciding disputes under the Plan and such interpretations, findings, determinations and decisions shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons for all purposes of the Plan. 9.2Amendments and Termination. This Plan may be modified or terminated at any time in accordance with the provisions of AT&T's Schedule of Authorizations. 9.3Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996. To the extent this Plan provides benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth, the Plan will cover the minimum length of stay required for deliveries (i.e., a 48-hour hospital stay after a vaginal delivery or a 96-hour stay following a delivery by Cesarean section.) The mother’s or newborn’s attending physician, after consulting with the mother, may discharge the mother or her newborn earlier than the minimum length of stay otherwise required by law. Such coverage shall be subject to all other provisions of this Plan.9.4Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998.

Such coverage shall be subject to all other provisions of this Plan.9.5Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. To the extent this Plan provides mental health benefits or substance use disorder benefits it will not place annual or lifetime maximums for such benefits that are lower than the annual and lifetime maximums for physical health benefits. In addition, the financial requirements (e.g., deductibles and co-payments) and treatment limitations (e.g., number of visits or days of coverage) that apply to mental health benefits or substance use disorder benefits will not be more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to substantially all medical/surgical benefits; mental health benefits and substance use disorder benefits will not be subject to any separate cost sharing requirements or treatment limitations that only apply to such benefits; if the Plan provides for out of network medical/surgical or substance use disorder benefits, it will provide for out of network mental health and substance use disorder benefits and standards for medical necessity determinations and reasons for any denial of benefits relating to mental health benefits and substance use disorder benefits will be made 17available upon request to plan participants. Such coverage shall be subject to all other provisions of this Plan.189.6Continuation of Coverage During Family or Medical Leave. During any period which an Active Employee Participant is on a family or medical leave as defined in the Family or Medical Leave Act, any benefit elections in force for such Participant shall remain in effect. While the Participant is on paid leave, contributions shall continue. If the Participant is on an unpaid leave, the Participant may elect to prepay required contributions on a pre-tax basis before the commencement of such unpaid leave. Alternatively, the Participant may elect to make such payments on an after-tax basis monthly in accordance with an arrangement that the Plan Administrator shall provide. If coverage is not continued during the entire period of the family or medical leave because the Participant declines to pay the premium, the coverage must be reinstated upon reemployment with no exclusions or waiting periods, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary. If the Participant does not return to work upon completion of the leave, the Participant must pay the full cost of any health care coverage that was continued on his/her behalf during the leave. These rules apply to the COBRA eligible programs. 9.7Rights While on Military Leave. Pursuant to the provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, an Active Employee Participant on military leave will be considered to be on a Leave of Absence and will be entitled during the leave to the health and welfare benefits that would be made available to other similarly situated employees if they were on a Leave of Absence. This entitlement will end if the individual provides written notice of intent not to return to work following the completion of the military leave. The individual shall have the right to continue his/her coverage, including any Dependent coverage, for the lesser of the length of the leave or 18 months. If the military leave is for a period of 31 days or more, the individual may be required to pay 102 percent of the total premium (determined in the same manner as a COBRA continuation coverage premium). If coverage is not continued during the entire period of the military leave because the individual declines to pay the premium or the leave extends beyond 18 months, the coverage must be reinstated upon reemployment with no pre-existing condition exclusions (other than for service-related illnesses or injuries) or waiting periods (other than those applicable to all Eligible Employees).9.8Qualified Medical Child Support Orders. The Plan will comply with any Qualified Medical Child Support Order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or administrative body that requires the Plan to provide medical coverage to a Dependent child of an Active Employee or Retired Employee Participant. The Plan Administrator will establish reasonable procedures for determining whether a court order or administrative decree requiring medical coverage for a Dependent child meets the requirements for a Qualified Medical Child Support Order. The cost of coverage or any additional cost of such coverage, if any, shall be borne by the Participant.9.9Right of Recovery. If the Plan has made an erroneous or excess payment to any Participant, the Plan Administrator shall be entitled to recover such excess from the individual or entity to whom such payments were made. The recovery of such overpayment may be made by offsetting the amount of any other benefit or amount payable by the amount of the overpayment under the Plan.ARTICLE 10 COBRA10.1Continuation of Coverage Under COBRA. Participants shall have all COBRA continuation rights required by federal law and all conversion rights. COBRA continuation coverage shall be continued as provided in this Article 10. 10.2COBRA Continuation Coverage for Terminated Participants. A covered Active Employee Participant may elect COBRA continuation coverage, at his/her own expense, if his participation under 19this Plan would terminate as a result of one of the following Qualifying Events: an Employee’s termination of employment or reduction of hours with an Employer. 2010.3COBRA Continuation Coverage for Dependents. A Qualified Dependent may elect COBRA continuation coverage, at his/her own expense, if his/her participation under this Plan would terminate as a result of a Qualifying Event. 10.4Period of Continuation Coverage for Covered Participants. A covered Active Employee Participant who qualifies for COBRA continuation coverage as a result of a Participant’s termination of employment or reduction in hours of employment described in Subsection 10.2 may elect COBRA continuation coverage for up to 18 months measured from the date of the Qualifying Event. Coverage under this Subsection 10.4 may not continue beyond the:(1)date on which the Active Employee Participant’s Employer ceases to maintain this Plan;(2)last day of the month for which premium payments have been made with respect to this Plan, if the individual fails to make premium payments on time, in accordance with Subsection 10.6;(3)date the covered Active Employee Participant becomes entitled to Medicare; or(4)date the covered Participant is no longer subject to a pre-existing condition exclusion under the Participant's other coverage or new employer plan for the type of coverage available under the COBRA eligible program for which the COBRA election was made.10.5Period of COBRA Continuation Coverage for Dependents. If a Qualified Dependent elects COBRA continuation coverage under a COBRA eligible program as a result of the an Active Employee Participant’s termination of employment as described in Subsection 10.2, continuation coverage may be continued for up to 18 months measured from the date of the Qualifying Event. COBRA continuation coverage for all other Qualifying Events may continue for up to 36 months.Continuation coverage under this Subsection 10.5 with respect to a COBRA eligible program may not continue beyond the date:(1)on which premium payments have not been made, in accordance with Subsection 10.6 below;(2)the Qualified Dependent becomes entitled to Medicare; (3)on which the Employer ceases to maintain this Plan; or(4)the Qualified Dependent is no longer subject to a pre-existing condition exclusion under the Participant’s other coverage or new employer plan for the type of coverage available under this Plan. 10.6Contribution Requirements for COBRA Continuation Coverage. Covered Participants and Qualified Dependents who elect COBRA continuation coverage as a result of a Qualifying Event will be required to pay continuation coverage payments. Continuation coverage payments are the payments required for COBRA continuation coverage that is an amount equal to a reasonable estimate of the cost to this Plan of providing coverage for all covered Participants at the time of the Qualifying Event plus a 2% administrative expense. In the case of a disabled individual who receives an additional 11-month extended coverage under COBRA, the Employer may assess up to 150% of the cost for this extended 21coverage period. Such cost shall be determined on an actuarial basis and take into account such factors as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe in regulations.22Covered Participants and Qualified Dependents must make the continuation coverage payment prior to the first day of the month in which such coverage will take effect. However, a covered Participant or Qualified Dependent has 45 days from the date of an affirmative election to pay the continuation coverage payment for the first month's payment and the cost for the period between the date medical coverage would otherwise have terminated due to the Qualifying Event and the date the covered Participant and/or Qualified Dependent actually elects COBRA continuation coverage. The covered Participant and/or Qualified Dependent shall have a 30-day grace period to make the continuation coverage payments due thereafter. Continuation coverage payments must be postmarked on or before the completion of the 30-day grace period. If continuation coverage payments are not made on a timely basis, COBRA continuation coverage will terminate as of the last day of the month for which timely premiums were made. The 30-day grace period shall not apply to the 45-day period for the first month’s payment of COBRA premiums as set out in the section above. If payment is received that is significantly less than the required continuation coverage payment, then continuation coverage will terminate as of the last day of the month for which premiums were paid. A payment is considered significantly less than the amount due if it is greater than the lesser of $50 or 10% of the required continuation coverage payment. Upon receipt of a continuation coverage payment that is insignificantly less than the required amount, the Plan Administrator must notify the covered Participant or Qualified Dependent of the amount of the shortfall and provide them with an additional 30-day grace period from the date of the notice for this payment only. 10.7Limitation on Participant's Rights to COBRA Continuation Coverage.(1)If a Qualified Dependent loses, or will lose medical coverage under this Plan as a result of divorce, legal separation, entitlement to Medicare, or ceasing to be a Dependent, such Qualified Dependent is responsible for notifying the Plan Administrator in writing within 60 days of the Qualifying Event. Failure to make timely notification will terminate the Qualified Dependent's rights to COBRA continuation coverage under this Article.(2)A Participant must complete and return the required enrollment materials within 60 days from the later of (a) the date of loss of coverage, or (b) the date the Plan Administrator sends notice of eligibility for COBRA continuation coverage. Failure to enroll for COBRA continuation coverage during this 60-day period will terminate all rights to COBRA continuation coverage under this Article. An affirmative election of COBRA continuation coverage by a Participant or his/her spouse shall be deemed to be an election for that Participant's Dependent(s) who would otherwise lose coverage under the Plan.10.8Subsequent Qualifying Event. If a second Qualifying Event occurs during an 18-month extension explained above, coverage may be continued for a maximum of 36 months from the date of the first Qualifying Event. In the event the Dependent loses coverage due to a Qualifying Event and after such date the Participant becomes entitled to Medicare, the Dependent shall have available up to 36 months of coverage measured from the date of the Qualifying Event that causes the loss of coverage. If the Participant was entitled to Medicare prior to the Qualifying Event, the Dependent shall have up to 36 months of coverage measured from the date of entitlement to Medicare.2310.9Extension of COBRA Continuation Period for Disabled Individuals.

The following describes the procedures used by the Plan to process claims for benefits, along with your rights and responsibilities.

However, you must complete the full claims and appeal process offered under the Plan before filing a lawsuit.Filing a Claim for BenefitsWhen filing a claim for benefits, you should file the claim with the Claims Administrator. The Claims Administrator is the third party to whom claims and appeal responsibility has been delegated as permitted under Section 9.1 of the Plan.The following are not considered claims for benefits under the Plan:•A claim related to basic eligibility for coverage under the Plan (See Section 12.2 of the Plan).•A claim related to the Loyalty Conditions contained in Article 8 of the Plan (See Section 12.2 of the Plan).Claim Filing LimitsA request for payment of benefits must be submitted within one year after the date of service or the date the prescription was provided.Required InformationWhen you request payment of benefits from the Plan, you must provide certain information as requested by the Claims Administrator. Benefit Determinations25Post-Service ClaimsPost-service claims are those claims that are filed for payment of benefits after medical care has been received. If your post-service claim is denied, you will receive a written notice from the Claims Administrator within 30 days of receipt of the claim, as long as all needed information identified above and any other information that the Claims Administrator may request in connection with services rendered to you was provided with the claim. The Claims Administrator will notify you within this 30-day period if additional information is needed to process the Claim and may request a one-time extension not longer than 15 days and pend your Claim until all information is received.Once notified of the extension, you then have 45 days to provide this information. If all of the needed information is received within the 45-day time frame and the claim is denied, the claims Administrator will notify you of the denial within 15 days after the information is received. If you don't provide the needed information within the 45-day period, your claim will be denied.26A denial notice will explain the reason for denial, refer to the part of the Plan on which the denial is based, and provide the claim appeal procedures.Pre-Service ClaimsPre-service claims are those claims that require notification or approval prior to receiving medical care or require notification within a specified time period after service begins as required under the Plan provisions.

As permitted by the Affordable Care Act, a grandfathered health plan can preserve certain basic health coverage that was already in effect when that law was enacted. Being a grandfathered health plan means that the plan may not include certain consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act that apply to other plans, for example, the requirement for the provision of preventive health services without any cost sharing. However, grandfathered health plans must comply with certain other consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act, for example, the elimination of lifetime limits on benefits.Questions regarding which protections apply and which protections do not apply to a grandfathered health plan and what might cause a plan to change from grandfathered health plan status can be directed to the plan administrator at P.O. Box 30558, Salt Lake City, Utah 84130-0558. You may also contact the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of labor at 1-866-444-3272 or www.dol.gov/ebsa/healthreform. This website has a table summarizing which protections do and do not apply to grandfathered health plans. 31APPENDIX DNotwithstanding the provisions and limitations of Section 2.15 of the Plan, the following Officers shall be included in the term “Eligible Employee” and shall be eligible to participate in the Plan (along with any Dependents) subject to all applicable provisions of the Plan:32 EX-31.1 5 exhibit3112q24.htm EX-31.1 CERTIFICATION OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER DocumentExhibit 31.1CERTIFICATION I, John T.
