NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS	
(unaudited)	
Note 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES	
Unaudited Interim Financial Information	
We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the lilles and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the	
"SEC") for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal	
recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented.	
Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2024 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain	
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United	
States ("GAAP") have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction	
with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, ' 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of our 2023 Annual	
Report on Form 10-K.	
Prior Period Reclassifications	
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. "Other assets" were reclassified out of "Accounts	
receivable, net and other" on our consolidated statements of cash flows.	
Principles of Consolidation	
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts ofAmazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the "Company"), consisting of its	
wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and ofwhich we are the pnmary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and	
certain entities that support our health care services. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.	
Use of Estimates	
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,	
revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but	
not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation	
forfeiture rates, vendor fitnding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and	
impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.	
We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January I, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from	
five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements In our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in	
estimate for Q3 2024, based on servers that were included in "Property and equipment, net" as of June 30, 2024 and those acquired during the three months ended	
September 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $760 million and a benefit to net income of $598 million, or $0.06 per basic share	
and $0.06 per diluted share. The effect of this change in estimate for the nine months ended September 3(), 2024, based on servers that were included in "Property	
and equipment, net" as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and	
amortization expense of $2.4 billion and a benefit to net income of $1.9 billion, or $0.18 per basic share and SO.18 per diluted share.

Earnings Per Share	
Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-	
average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss,	
stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.

Inventories	
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and	
net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through	
sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition categow. The inventory valuation	
allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was S3.0 billion and S2.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

Q3 2024, and S13.0 billion and S14.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.	
Unearned Revenue	
Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.	
Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31 , 2023 was	
$20.9 billion, of which S12.5 billion was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in "Other long-term liabilities" on our	
consolidated balance sheets was S5.7 billion and S7.0 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.	
Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not	
yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were	
approximately S164 billion as of September 30, 2024. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.9 years. However, the amount and timing	
of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.	
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted	
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") amending existing income tax disclosure	
guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting	
periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with

early adoption permitted, and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our income	
tax disclosures.	
Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS	
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities	
As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-	
rated money market ftnds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents	
and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an	
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes	
the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:	
Level I—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.	
Level 2—VaIuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level I, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active	
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by	
observable market data.	
Level 3—Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market	
participants. These valuations require significant judgment.	
We measure the fair value of money market åtnds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or	
liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar	
instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
